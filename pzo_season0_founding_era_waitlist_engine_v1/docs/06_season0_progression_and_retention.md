# Season 0 Progression and Retention in pzo_season0_founding_era_waitlist_engine_v1

## Overview

The game progression and retention system in pzo_season0_founding_era_waitlist_engine_v1 is designed around a 4-act arc and 4 retention loops, with QoL controls to enhance player experience. The system ensures a balanced and engaging gameplay experience while maintaining strict TypeScript coding standards.

## Non-negotiables

1. Strict adherence to TypeScript, using precise execution-grade language and avoiding the use of 'any'. All code is written in strict mode.
2. Deterministic effects for fairness and reproducibility.
3. The 4-act arc (Claim/Build/Proof/Seal) provides a structured gameplay experience.
4. The 4 retention loops (Streak/Event/Collection/Social) encourage player engagement and retention.
5. QoL controls (grace rules/lightweight missions/clear progress) improve the overall user experience.

## Implementation Spec

### 4-act Arc

1. **Claim**: Players start by claiming their initial resources and assets. This sets the foundation for their financial empire.
2. **Build**: Players use their resources to build infrastructure, expanding their financial roguelike game.
3. **Proof**: Players must prove their skills and strategies through various challenges and events.
4. **Seal**: Upon successful completion of the previous steps, players seal their position in the game, unlocking new opportunities for growth.

### 4 Retention Loops

1. **Streak**: Players are rewarded for maintaining a certain level of activity or success over a specified period.
2. **Event**: Special events offer limited-time opportunities for bonus rewards and unique experiences.
3. **Collection**: Players can collect items, assets, or achievements to progress through the game and unlock new content.
4. **Social**: Social interactions with other players, such as trading resources or forming alliances, encourage continued engagement.

### QoL Controls

1. **Grace Rules**: Certain penalties or restrictions are waived during specific periods to help players catch up or recover from setbacks.
2. **Lightweight Missions**: Simple tasks or challenges provide immediate rewards and quick progress for new or struggling players.
3. **Clear Progress**: The game provides clear visual indicators of player progress, making it easy to understand and track.

## Edge Cases

1. In the event of a server outage or other technical issues, grace rules may be extended to minimize player inconvenience.
2. If a player encounters an unexpected bug or error, they should be able to report it through in-game channels for prompt resolution.
3. Players who are consistently inactive for extended periods may have their accounts flagged for review and potential closure if resources are being abused.
