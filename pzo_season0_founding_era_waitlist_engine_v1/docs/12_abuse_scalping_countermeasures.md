This document outlines the measures taken to prevent abuse and scalping within the `pzo_season0_founding_era_waitlist_engine_v1`.

## Overview

We have identified five primary threat vectors that could potentially be exploited for abuse or scalping:

1. Multiple Account Creation
2. Automated Bot Usage
3. Selling Waitlist Positions
4. Manipulation of In-game Economy
5. Exploitation of Game Mechanics

To counter these threats, we have implemented five control measures:

1. Account Verification and Limits
2. Bot Detection and Prevention
3. Non-Transferable Waitlist Positions
4. Economic Balancing and Monitoring
5. Regular Audits and Updates

## Non-negotiables

1. **Account Security**: All users must adhere to our strict account security policies, including two-factor authentication and strong passwords.
2. **Fair Play**: Any attempt to manipulate the game or its economy will result in permanent account suspension.
3. **Respect**: Harassment, hate speech, or any form of disrespectful behavior towards other players or our team is strictly prohibited.

## Implementation Spec

### Account Verification and Limits

- All users must verify their email addresses upon registration.
- We limit the number of accounts per IP address to prevent account farming.
- Suspicious activity may trigger additional verification checks.

### Bot Detection and Prevention

- We monitor user behavior for signs of automation, such as rapid transactions or identical actions across multiple accounts.
- Users suspected of bot usage will be temporarily locked out and required to pass a manual review before regaining access.

### Non-Transferable Waitlist Positions

- Waitlist positions cannot be sold, traded, or transferred in any way.
- Attempts to do so will result in the forfeiture of the position and potential account suspension.

### Economic Balancing and Monitoring

- We regularly monitor the game's economy for signs of manipulation or imbalance.
- Prices and item availability are adjusted as needed to maintain a fair and balanced market.

### Regular Audits and Updates

- Our team conducts regular audits to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities or exploits.
- The game is updated regularly to improve security, add new features, and enhance the user experience.

## Edge Cases

In some cases, legitimate users may inadvertently trigger bot detection due to rapid transactions or identical actions. In these instances, we will review the account activity manually before taking any action.

## Policy Stance

We take a calm yet firm approach to enforcing our policies. Our primary goal is to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for all players. Any attempts to exploit the system will be met with swift and appropriate action. We appreciate your cooperation in maintaining a secure and fun environment for everyone.
