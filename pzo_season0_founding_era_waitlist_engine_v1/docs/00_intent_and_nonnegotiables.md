# Point Zero One Digital: Founding Era Waitlist Engine Documentation - Non-Negotiables, Implementation Spec, Edge Cases

## Overview

This document outlines the non-negotiables, implementation specifications, and edge cases for the Founding Era Waitlist Engine in our flagship game, Point Zero One Digital. The engine is designed to uphold the core principles of the game while ensuring a seamless player experience.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Limited-time**: The waitlist will only be available during specific timeframes, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity.

2. **Non-repurchasable**: Once a player secures a spot on the waitlist, they cannot purchase additional spots or transfer their position to another player.

3. **Identity-first**: Player identities are prioritized over in-game assets. No pay-to-win mechanics will be implemented.

4. **Proof-backed**: All in-game actions and transactions will be transparently recorded, ensuring fairness and accountability.

5. **No-pay2win**: In-app purchases will not provide players with an unfair advantage over other players.

6. **Low-friction**: The waitlist registration process will be simple and straightforward to minimize barriers for potential players.

7. **Built-in retention**: Mechanisms will be implemented to encourage player engagement and reduce churn, ensuring a vibrant and active community.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Limited-time**: The waitlist will be open for a predefined period, after which it will close until the next season.

2. **Non-repurchasable**: Each player can only secure one spot on the waitlist during each founding era.

3. **Identity-first**: Player identities are tied to their accounts, and no in-game assets can be traded or sold for real-world currency.

4. **Proof-backed**: All transactions will be recorded on a public blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.

5. **No-pay2win**: In-app purchases will only provide cosmetic changes or temporary boosts, never affecting gameplay balance.

6. **Low-friction**: The waitlist registration process will require minimal information from players, making it quick and easy to join.

7. **Built-in retention**: Players will receive regular in-game rewards for logging in and participating in events, encouraging continued engagement.

## Edge Cases

1. **Account recovery**: In case of lost or stolen accounts, a player may be able to recover their account by providing proof of identity and demonstrating ownership of the associated assets.

2. **In-app purchases**: If a player accidentally makes an in-app purchase that violates our no-pay2win policy, we will issue a refund and take appropriate action against the offending party.

3. **Account merging**: In rare cases where multiple accounts belonging to the same player are discovered, we may merge them to ensure fairness and maintain the integrity of the game.
