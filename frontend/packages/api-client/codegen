Here is the content for the `frontend/packages/api-client/codegen` file, adhering to the specified rules and guidelines:

```typescript
/**
 * API Client Generated Bindings
 */

import axios from 'axios';

// Public Symbols
export const apiClient = createApiClient();

function createApiClient(): ApiClient {
  const baseURL = 'https://api.pointzeroonedigital.com/v1';

  return {
    getSnippetJobStatus: async (jobId: string): Promise<SnippetJobStatus> => {
      const response = await axios.get(`${baseURL}/snippets/${jobId}`);
      return response.data;
    },

    // Add more API methods as needed
  };
}

// Types
type SnippetJobStatus = {
  /** The unique identifier for the snippet job */
  id: string;

  /** The current status of the snippet job */
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed';

  /** The timestamp when the snippet job was created */
  createdAt: Date;

  /** The timestamp when the snippet job was last updated */
  updatedAt: Date;
};

// JSDoc comments for better documentation and TypeScript type inference
```

Regarding SQL, YAML/JSON, and Terraform, since they were not specified in the given spec, I did not include them in this output. However, if you need help with those files as well, please let me know!
