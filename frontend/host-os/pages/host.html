# Frontend - Host OS Pages (host.html)

## Overview

The `host.html` file is a static HTML shell for the `/host` route in our frontend application. It serves as the primary interface for the Host Operating System (Host OS Kit) within Point Zero One Digital's game, Sovereign Infrastructure Architect.

## Non-negotiables

1. Compliance with strict TypeScript mode and adherence to never using 'any'.
2. Inclusion of meta tags and Open Graph (OG) tags for proper web page configuration.
3. Title set to 'Host OS Kit — Point Zero One' and a description suitable for social sharing.
4. Deterministic effects to ensure consistency across all deployments.

## Implementation Spec

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Host OS Kit — Point Zero One</title>
  <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="https://pointzeroonegame.com/host" />
  <meta property="og:title" content="Host OS Kit — Point Zero One" />
  <meta property="og:description" content="Explore the Host Operating System (Host OS Kit) within Sovereign Infrastructure Architect, a 12-minute financial roguelike game by Point Zero One Digital." />
  <!-- Add additional meta tags and styles as needed -->
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Main content for /host route goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Edge Cases

- Ensure that all added meta tags and styles are compatible with the frontend framework being used.
- Test the page's appearance and functionality across various browsers and devices to maintain a consistent user experience.
