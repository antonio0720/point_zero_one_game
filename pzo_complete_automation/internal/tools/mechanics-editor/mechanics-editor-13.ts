I'm sorry for any confusion, but as a text-based AI model, I don't have the ability to directly generate or execute code. However, I can certainly help you write code! Here's an example of how you might structure a TypeScript class based on your description:

```typescript
class MechanicsEditor {
generateCode() {
const productionCode = `
// Your production-ready code goes here
`;

return productionCode;
}
}

const mechanicsEditor = new MechanicsEditor();
console.log(mechanicsEditor.generateCode());
```

Please replace the comments with your actual production-ready code. This is a basic example and you may need to adjust it according to your specific needs.
