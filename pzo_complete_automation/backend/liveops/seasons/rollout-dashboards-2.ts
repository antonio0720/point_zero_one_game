1. Adding error handling for potential exceptions like `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`, etc., in the service methods.
2. Implementing a Mongoose hook to handle timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt).
3. Setting up database connection and configuration using `@nestjs/mongoose`.
4. Implementing unit tests for your services and controllers using `jest` or other testing frameworks.
5. Ensuring proper security measures like data encryption, input validation, authorization, and rate limiting are in place to protect against potential attacks and improve the application's robustness.
