- The `@nestjs/common`, `@nestjs/jwt`, and `@nestjs/entitlements` packages are installed and imported properly.
- The `EntitlementService` class is implemented elsewhere in your application.
- There are two payment strategies: PaypalService and StripeService, each with a createPaymentIntent method that initializes a new payment using the corresponding API. In this example, we only show the Stripe integration, but you can add more payment methods by creating additional services (e.g., `SquareService`, `AuthorizeNetService`, etc.) and swapping them in the constructor based on your needs.
- The CreatePaymentDto and Payment interfaces should be defined elsewhere in your application.
