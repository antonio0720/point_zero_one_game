1. Importing the necessary modules, including the model and testing tools like Chai and Mocha.
2. Defining a `DeckReactorRL8` instance for each test with a `beforeEach` hook.
3. Writing test cases for initializing the model and testing its learning and application of learned strategies.
4. Using async/await for any asynchronous operations like learning or simulating games.
