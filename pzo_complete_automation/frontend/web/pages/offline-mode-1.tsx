Here's a simplified TypeScript React component for the described file `offline-mode-1.tsx`. This is a minimal example and may not cover all edge cases or styling that your application requires.

```typescript
import React from 'react';

const OfflineModeOne: React.FC = () => {
return (
<div>
<h1>Offline Mode One</h1>
<!-- You can add content and components as needed -->
</div>
);
};

export default OfflineModeOne;
```

This code creates a functional React component named `OfflineModeOne`. It renders an `h1` tag with the title "Offline Mode One". You can modify this component to add your desired functionality.
