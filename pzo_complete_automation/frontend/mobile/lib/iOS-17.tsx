I'm unable to generate actual code without specific project details, but here's a simplified example of what an iOS-17 SwiftUI project might look like:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
var body: some View {
Text("Welcome to iOS-17!")
.padding()
}
}

@main
struct iOS17App: App {
var body: some Scene {
WindowGroup {
ContentView()
}
}
}
```

Keep in mind that you'll need to install Xcode 17 and its accompanying iOS SDK to test and run this code on an actual device or simulator.
