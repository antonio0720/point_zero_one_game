I'm unable to generate or write code without context or a specific request. Here is an example of how a part of your Android project could look like in TypeScript for a React Native application:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const Android3Screen = () => {
return (
<View>
<Text>Welcome to Android-3</Text>
</View>
);
};

export default Android3Screen;
```
