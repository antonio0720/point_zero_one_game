Here's a simplified example of a React Native component for an Android-16 screen in TypeScript. Please note that this is just a basic structure and doesn't include any specific logic or styling you might need for your project.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const Android16Screen = () => {
return (
<View>
<Text>Welcome to Android-16 Screen</Text>
</View>
);
};

export default Android16Screen;
```

In this example, we import the View and Text components from React Native. We then define a functional component called `Android16Screen`, which returns a simple view containing a text message. Finally, we export the component for use in other parts of our app.
