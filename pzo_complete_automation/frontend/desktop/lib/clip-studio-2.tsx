Here is a simplified example of a TypeScript file for a desktop application named `clip-studio-2`. Note that this is a minimal and basic structure, and you would need to expand it according to your project's requirements.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class App extends React.Component {
render() {
return (
<div>
Clip Studio 2
</div>
);
}
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

This example utilizes the React library to create a simple user interface for `clip-studio-2`. The application displays the text "Clip Studio 2" on screen. You should include the needed dependencies in your project and replace the content inside the `App` class with your own component structure.

```json
{
"dependencies": {
"react": "^17.0.2",
"react-dom": "^17.0.2"
}
}
```
