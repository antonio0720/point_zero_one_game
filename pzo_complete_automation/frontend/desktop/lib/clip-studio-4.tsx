I'm unable to generate a complete, production-ready code without context or project structure. However, I can provide you an example of how a TypeScript React component could be structured based on your description.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

type Props = {};

const ClipStudio4: React.FC<Props> = () => {
return (
<div className='clip-studio-4'>
{/* Add your component content here */}
</div>
);
};

export default ClipStudio4;
```
