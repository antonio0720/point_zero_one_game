```typescript
import React from 'react';

interface PlayerSupport7Props {
// Add any props specific to PlayerSupport7 here
}

const PlayerSupport7: React.FC<PlayerSupport7Props> = ({ /* props */ }) => {
return (
<div>
{/* UI components for the player support dashboard 7 */}
</div>
);
};

export default PlayerSupport7;
```

For a complete, production-ready version, you would want to consider adding additional features such as error handling, routing, state management (e.g., Redux or MobX), and styling (CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled-Components or Emotion). Also, don't forget to minify your code for better performance in production environments.
