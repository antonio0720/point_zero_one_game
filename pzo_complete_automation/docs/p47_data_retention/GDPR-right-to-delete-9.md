# Data Retention & Deletion Automation - GDPR-right-to-delete-9

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation and policies related to data retention and deletion automation in compliance with the GDPR's right to erasure or "the right to be forgotten" (Article 17).

## Scope

The scope of this policy includes all personal data processed by our organization that originates from EU residents.

## Data Retention

We retain personal data for as long as it is necessary and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or for which it was further processed, unless otherwise required by law. We have a retention policy in place to ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.

## Deletion Automation

To facilitate the GDPR's right to erasure, we have implemented automated deletion processes for personal data. These processes are designed to identify and remove personal data that is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.

### Identification of Data for Erasure

1. **Expiry of Retention Period**: The primary method for identifying data for erasure is through the expiration of the retention period as outlined in our retention policy.

2. **Data Subject Request**: We will also erase personal data in response to a data subject's request, provided that no other legal grounds for processing override this right.

3. **Automated Decision-making and Profiling**: In cases where automated decision-making and profiling occur, the results will be regularly reviewed, and personal data used in these processes will be subject to erasure when no longer necessary.

## Exceptions

There are certain situations where we may not be able to immediately comply with a request for erasure. These exceptions include, but are not limited to:

1. **Legal Obligations**: We may need to retain personal data to comply with legal obligations, such as tax or accounting laws.

2. **Exercise of Freedom of Expression and Information**: The right to freedom of expression and information may override the right to erasure.

3. **Public Interest Grounds**: In some cases, it may be necessary to retain personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes.

## Data Security

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. This includes securing the automated deletion processes to prevent unauthorized access or accidental erasure of personal data.

## Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to reflect changes in our data processing activities, legal requirements, or best practices related to data protection.
