# Compliance Audits - Data Retention and Deletion Automation

This document outlines the procedures for data retention, deletion, and automation to ensure compliance with various regulations and standards.

## Data Retention Policy

1. **Data Classification**: Classify data based on their sensitivity, importance, and regulatory requirements. This includes personal data (PII), financial data, and proprietary information.

2. **Storage Periods**: Define the minimum and maximum retention periods for each data class in accordance with legal, contractual, and business needs.

3. **Backup**: Implement regular backups to ensure data integrity and enable quick recovery in case of loss or damage. Backup data should also adhere to the same retention policy.

## Data Deletion Procedure

1. **Identification**: Identify and flag data that has reached its retention period for deletion. This can be done manually or through automated tools.

2. **Verification**: Verify the identified data before deletion to ensure it is no longer required for any ongoing legal, regulatory, or business purposes.

3. **Deletion**: Perform secure deletion of the identified data, ensuring that it cannot be recovered or accessed in any form. This includes physical destruction of hard copies and permanent erasure of digital records.

## Data Deletion Automation

1. **Automated Scheduling**: Implement automated scheduling for data deletion based on predefined retention periods.

2. **Event-Based Triggers**: Set up event-based triggers to initiate data deletion when certain conditions are met, such as the closure of a case or project.

3. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Regularly monitor the automation system to ensure it is functioning correctly and report any issues for immediate resolution.

## Compliance Considerations

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, among others.

2. **Data Privacy**: Protect the privacy of individuals by adhering to data protection laws and best practices.

3. **Legal Obligations**: Be aware of any legal obligations that may require data retention for longer than the initial retention period, such as ongoing litigation or investigations.

4. **Business Needs**: Balance data deletion with the need to maintain data for business purposes, such as analytics and historical records.
