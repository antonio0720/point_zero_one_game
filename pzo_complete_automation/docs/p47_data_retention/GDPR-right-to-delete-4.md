# Data Retention and Deletion Automation - GDPR Right to Delete (Article 17)

This document outlines the process for data retention and deletion automation in compliance with the GDPR's Right to Erasure (Article 17).

## Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides individuals with a right to erasure, also known as 'the right to be forgotten'. This gives them the power to request deletion of their personal data when there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.

## Key Concepts

1. **Data Subject Request**: A request made by an individual to a controller to exercise their right to erasure.
2. **Compelling Reasons for Data Retention**: Certain circumstances that may prevent the controller from deleting the data, such as compliance with legal obligations, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
3. **Data Erasure Procedure**
- Verify the identity of the requester.
- Assess whether the data subject's request is valid and there are no compelling reasons for retention.
- If valid, initiate the deletion process as soon as possible and confirm to the data subject that their data has been deleted.
4. **Data Retention Automation**
- Implementing data deletion automation can help in efficiently handling data erasure requests and maintaining compliance with GDPR.
- Automated solutions should be designed to identify, locate, and delete personal data when a request is made.

## Best Practices for Data Retention and Deletion Automation

1. Keep records of all deletion requests and actions taken to demonstrate compliance with GDPR.
2. Regularly review and update data retention policies to ensure they are aligned with the GDPR requirements.
3. Ensure that automated solutions do not inadvertently delete non-personal or necessary data.
4. Implement processes for handling exceptions, such as data retention due to legal obligations or legitimate interests.
