Title: Feature Restrictions - Age Gating & Parental Controls (v2)

## Overview

This document outlines the feature restrictions for Age Gating and Parental Controls in version 2. The goal is to provide clarity on what features are restricted, when, and for whom.

## Feature Restrictions by User Type

### Minor Users (Under Age of Consent)

1. Access to certain content may be age-gated, meaning users under the age of consent cannot access it.
2. Parental controls can be set up by an authorized adult to restrict or monitor a minor's activities within our service. Restrictions might include:
- Time limits on usage
- Content filtering based on age-appropriateness
- Communication restrictions with other users
3. Payment functionality is disabled for minor users; they cannot make purchases or subscriptions.

### Adult Users (Over Age of Consent)

1. Access to all content, unless specifically restricted for any reason.
2. Payment functionality is enabled, allowing users to make purchases and subscriptions.

## Parental Control Setup Process

1. Account creation: An authorized adult creates an account and sets up parental controls during the sign-up process or at a later time in the account settings.
2. User identification: The adult links their account with a minor user's account to enable parental control features.
3. Control customization: The adult can then adjust various settings, such as content filters, usage limits, and communication restrictions, according to their preferences and the age of the minor user.
4. Ongoing management: Parents/guardians can review and modify their child's activity and settings at any time within the account settings.

## Age Verification Process

1. User sign-up: During registration, users are prompted to verify their age using a third-party age verification service (e.g., government ID verification).
2. Age validation: The user's identity and age are verified against our age-gating policy, which typically requires users to be of the legal age of consent in their country or region.
3. Access granted or denied: Based on the age verification results, users will either gain access to all content (for adults) or be restricted from certain features (for minors).
4. Age verification reminder: Users who have previously failed age verification may be prompted periodically to re-verify their age when using our service.

## Compliance and Exceptions

We comply with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines regarding data privacy, children's online protection, and user consent. However, exceptions might occur due to regional differences in age of consent or specific content restrictions. In such cases, users will be notified about any relevant restrictions during the sign-up process or while accessing restricted content.
