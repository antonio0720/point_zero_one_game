Title: Feature Restrictions (v7) - Parental Controls & Age Gating

## Overview

This document outlines the restrictions implemented for features in version 7, focusing on Parental Controls and Age Gating.

## Parental Controls

Parental Controls are designed to help parents manage their children's access to certain content or features within our platform. The following features are subject to parental control:

1. Content Access: Restrict access to specific types of content based on age-appropriateness ratings.
2. Interaction Limitations: Limit interactions between children and other users, such as communication or sharing of personal information.
3. Time Management: Set limits on the amount of time a child can spend using the platform daily or weekly.
4. Activity Monitoring: Parents can view their children's activity logs to keep track of their online behavior.
5. Approval System: Require parental approval for certain actions, such as purchasing content or interacting with other users.

## Age Gating

Age Gating is a feature designed to ensure that only users who meet the minimum age requirement can access our platform. This helps protect children from inappropriate content and interactions. Users will be required to provide their date of birth during registration, and access will be granted only if they are above the specified age.

## Implementation Details

1. Parental Controls can be managed through a dedicated parent dashboard or via email notifications.
2. Age Gating is automatically enabled for all users, but parents can adjust settings within Parental Controls to customize their children's online experience.
3. Users who fail the age verification process will be unable to access the platform until they provide valid proof of age.
4. The minimum age requirement may vary depending on local regulations and laws.

## Future Updates

We are committed to continually improving our Parental Controls and Age Gating features based on user feedback and evolving industry standards. Please check back for updates or contact our support team for more information.
