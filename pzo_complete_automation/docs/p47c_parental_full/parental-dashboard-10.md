## Enhanced Parental Controls

### Activity Monitoring

The revamped activity monitoring feature provides a more detailed overview of your child's online behavior, including website visits, app usage, and search history. This information can help you identify potential risks and guide discussions about internet safety.

The updated content filtering system offers more granular control over the type of content your child can access online. You can now block or allow categories such as violence, adult content, and gambling, ensuring a safer online environment for your child.

## Age Gating

The age-gating feature has been significantly improved to provide a more secure method of verifying users' ages. This process includes enhanced identity verification methods and stricter access policies for underage users.

### Identity Verification

Users will now be required to submit multiple forms of identification, including government-issued IDs and proof of address, to verify their age accurately.

### Access Policies

Underage users who pass the identity verification process will still be subject to stricter access policies, such as limited functionality in certain areas of the platform and supervised browsing.

## Conclusion

The enhanced age-gating system provides an extra layer of security for younger users, while the revamped activity monitoring, time management, and content filtering features offer greater control over your child's internet activities.
