Title: COPPA Compliance - Parental Controls & Age Gating (v1.0)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the implementation of Parental Controls and Age Gating, ensuring compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). This process aims to protect children under 13 while maintaining a user-friendly experience for all users.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all digital properties owned or operated by our organization that are directed towards children under 13, as well as those with general audience that have actual knowledge that they collect, use, or disclose personal information from children.

## 3. Parental Consent

Before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child, we will require the child's parent to provide verifiable consent. This can be achieved through:

1. Active-consent method: A parent is required to affirmatively agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of their child’s personal information before we collect any such information.
2. Passive-consent method: If the digital property is primarily directed toward an audience older than 13, and if parents would reasonably understand that personal information might be collected, only minimal personal information (such as a username or email address for notification purposes) may be collected without active consent.

## 4. Age Gating

We will implement age-gating mechanisms to ensure that no one under the age of 13 is knowingly providing personal information. These mechanisms could include:

1. Age verification at registration: Users must provide their age during registration, and access will be granted only if they are over 13.
2. Age verification at key content areas: Access to certain features or content may be restricted until the user's age is verified.

## 5. Parental Access and Control

We will offer parents the ability to review their child’s personal information, direct us to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of their child’s information. This can be achieved through:

1. A parent dashboard: Providing a secure online account for parents where they can review, modify, or delete their child's personal information.
2. Opt-out option: Offering parents the ability to opt out from the collection, use, or disclosure of their child’s personal information.

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

We will retain collected personal data only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and to comply with legal obligations. Upon a parent's request, we will delete the child’s personal information from our servers promptly.

## 7. Ongoing Compliance

We will regularly review and update this policy as needed to ensure ongoing compliance with COPPA regulations. This may include conducting audits, training staff, and maintaining records of parental consent and verification.
