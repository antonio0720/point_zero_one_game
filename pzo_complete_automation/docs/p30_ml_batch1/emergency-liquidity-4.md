# Emergency Liquidity (ML Companions Batch 1, Task 4)

## Overview

This document outlines the fourth task of the Machine Learning (ML) Companions Batch 1 project focused on Emergency Liquidity. The goal is to develop a predictive model that identifies banks in need of emergency liquidity based on various financial indicators.

## Problem Statement

The financial crisis of 2008 highlighted the importance of identifying banks in need of emergency liquidity as early as possible to prevent systemic risks. This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of predicting banks requiring emergency liquidity, given historical financial data and other relevant factors.

## Data

The dataset for this task contains information about multiple banks across various years, including financial indicators such as:

1. Net interest margin
2. Non-performing loans ratio
3. Capital adequacy ratio
4. Return on assets
5. Liquidity coverage ratio
6. Total capital ratio
7. Leverage ratio
8. Loan loss provisioning
9. Tier 1 capital
10. Net income

## Tasks

1. Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers as necessary.
2. Feature engineering: Create new features that could potentially improve the model's performance.
3. Model selection: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model for this task.
4. Evaluation and optimization: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, and optimize it to improve its accuracy.
5. Deployment: Implement the optimized model in a production environment to predict banks requiring emergency liquidity.

## Deliverables

1. A Jupyter notebook documenting the entire process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and optimization steps.
2. An optimized machine learning model capable of accurately predicting banks in need of emergency liquidity.
3. Documentation explaining the model's architecture, performance, and potential limitations.
4. A dashboard or web application (optional) for easy access and visualization of the results.
