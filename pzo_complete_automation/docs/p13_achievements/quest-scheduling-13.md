# Quest Scheduling - Version 1.3

This document outlines the latest updates and features related to Achievements, Quests, and Battle Pass in our game, specifically focusing on Quest Scheduling (v1.3).

## Updates

- **Quest Scheduling System (v1.3):** We have implemented a new system that allows for more organized and dynamic quest scheduling. This update aims to provide players with a smoother gaming experience by ensuring that appropriate quests are available at the right times.

### New Features

1. **Daily Quests:** A fresh set of daily quests will be available each day, offering players a new challenge and reward cycle. These quests can include various objectives such as defeating specific enemies, collecting resources, or completing achievements.

2. **Weekly Quests:** In addition to daily quests, we have introduced weekly quests that offer more substantial rewards and take longer to complete. These quests will change every week, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging for our players.

3. **Event Quests:** Special events will now feature their own unique set of quests that tie into the event's theme. These event quests will provide players with exclusive rewards and a more immersive experience during the event period.

4. **Battle Pass Quests:** To complement our Battle Pass system, we have added new quests designed to guide players through the Battle Pass tiers, offering additional incentives for progression and completion.

### Balance Changes

- We have adjusted the difficulty of certain quests to better match player skill levels and provide a fair challenge.
- Rewards for completed quests have been slightly increased to encourage more participation and make progression feel more rewarding.

We hope these updates improve your gaming experience and keep you engaged in our game. Stay tuned for future updates as we continue to refine and expand our Achievements, Quests, and Battle Pass systems.
