Achievements are specific, self-contained goals that players can aim to accomplish within the game. They come in various forms, such as completing certain tasks, discovering hidden items, or achieving a high score on a particular level. Achievements are designed to encourage exploration, mastery, and personal development while offering unique rewards for successful completion.

Quests

Quests offer players a series of challenges that guide them through the game's world, introducing new concepts, characters, and storylines as they progress. Quests can be linear or non-linear, with multiple paths leading to different outcomes. They provide an engaging narrative structure, encouraging players to immerse themselves in the game's universe while earning valuable rewards along the way.

Battle Pass

The Battle Pass is a seasonal progression system that rewards players for their active participation in multiplayer modes. By purchasing the pass or earning it through various means, players gain access to exclusive content, such as cosmetic items, emotes, and other bonuses. The Battle Pass features multiple tiers, with each tier offering increasingly valuable rewards as players advance.

Proof-Based Progression
