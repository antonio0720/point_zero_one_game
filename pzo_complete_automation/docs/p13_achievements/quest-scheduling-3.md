# Quest Scheduling v3

This document outlines the changes and updates in the Quest Scheduling system for version 3.

## Overview

In this update, we've made significant improvements to the Quest Scheduling system to provide a more engaging and diverse gaming experience.

## Highlights

1. **Daily and Weekly Quests**: We've expanded the number of daily and weekly quests available, offering players a wider variety of tasks to complete each day and week.

2. **Dynamic Quest Generation**: To keep gameplay fresh and exciting, we've implemented a dynamic quest generation system that creates unique challenges based on player progression and current in-game events.

3. **Quests and Achievements Integration**: We've integrated Quests with the existing Achievement system, allowing players to earn additional rewards for completing specific quest chains or achieving certain milestones within a quest.

4. **Battle Pass Quests**: We've added Battle Pass-exclusive quests that provide exclusive rewards and help players progress through the Battle Pass tiers more quickly.

## Changes

1. **Quest Difficulty Adjustments**: Some daily and weekly quests have had their difficulty adjusted to better match the intended level of challenge.

2. **Reward Optimization**: We've reviewed and optimized the rewards associated with various quests to ensure they provide appropriate incentives for players.

3. **Quests and Achievements UI Improvements**: The user interface for both Quests and Achievements has been refined to make it easier for players to track their progress and find new quests or achievements to complete.

## Known Issues

1. There may be occasional issues with dynamic quest generation, leading to repetitive quests or unbalanced difficulty levels. Our development team is actively working on resolving these issues.

2. Some players have reported an issue where Battle Pass-exclusive quests are not showing up in their Quest log. We are currently investigating this problem and will provide a resolution as soon as possible.
