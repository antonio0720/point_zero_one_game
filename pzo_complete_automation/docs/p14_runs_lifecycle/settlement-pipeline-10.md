Overview
--------

The Settlement Pipeline version 10 is a key component of our system, responsible for processing and settling transactions. This pipeline ensures the accurate and timely settlement of transactions between parties, maintaining the integrity of our financial system.

Components
----------

### Data Ingestion

The data ingestion component receives raw transaction data from various sources and validates it before passing it on to the next stages.

### Transaction Processing

This stage filters and sorts the transactions based on their type, validity, and other criteria. It also handles any exceptions or errors that may occur during this process.

### Risk Assessment

The risk assessment component evaluates each transaction for potential fraud or anomalies using various algorithms and models. Transactions deemed high-risk are flagged for manual review.

### Settlement Engine

The settlement engine is responsible for executing the actual settlement of approved transactions. It communicates with relevant parties to transfer funds, update account balances, and generate necessary records.

### Reporting
