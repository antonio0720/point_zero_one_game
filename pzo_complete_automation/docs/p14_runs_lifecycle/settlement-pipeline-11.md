Pipeline Stages
---------------

### Data Ingestion

The process begins with data ingestion from various sources such as banks, trading platforms, and other financial institutions. The data is validated for accuracy and completeness before being stored in the pipeline's database.

### Transaction Matching

In this stage, the system matches incoming transactions based on criteria like account numbers, transaction dates, and amounts. Matched transactions are then grouped together for further processing.

### Risk Assessment & Compliance Check

The system performs a comprehensive risk assessment and compliance check on each matched transaction. This includes verifying the legitimacy of the transaction, checking against fraudulent activities, and ensuring adherence to regulatory guidelines.

### Funds Transfer

Once the transactions have passed the risk assessment and compliance checks, the system initiates the transfer of funds between the involved parties. The transfers are executed through secure channels to ensure the safety and integrity of the funds.

### Confirmation & Reconciliation

After the funds transfer, the system sends confirmation messages to all parties involved. The confirmed transactions are then reconciled to ensure that they match the original records in the database. Any discrepancies are investigated and resolved.

### Reporting & Analysis

The final stage of the pipeline involves generating reports and conducting analysis on the settled transactions. These reports provide valuable insights into the financial health of the organization, identify trends, and help in making informed decisions.
