# Cryptographic Receipts 2: Verifier and Proof Cards

This document outlines the functionality, components, and usage of the Cryptographic Receipt Verifier and Proof Cards in version 2 of the system.

## Overview

Cryptographic Receipts 2 is an enhanced version of the original cryptographic receipt system, which provides a secure method for verifying the authenticity and validity of transactions without disclosing sensitive transaction details. This version introduces the Verifier and Proof Cards as key components.

### Verifier

The Verifier is a tool responsible for validating the integrity of cryptographic receipts produced by a Merchant. It uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that the receipt accurately reflects the transaction and has not been tampered with or manipulated.

#### Key Features:

1. **Transaction Verification:** The Verifier checks whether the transaction details in the receipt correspond to an actual transaction made by the consumer.
2. **Receipt Authentication:** The Verifier confirms that the cryptographic receipt was issued by a trusted Merchant.
3. **Proof of Validity:** Upon successful verification, the Verifier generates a Proof Card that attests to the validity of the transaction and can be shared with third parties if necessary.
4. **Confidentiality Preservation:** The Verifier ensures that sensitive transaction details remain confidential during the verification process.

### Proof Cards

Proof Cards are digital tokens generated by the Verifier upon successful verification of a cryptographic receipt. They serve as a verifiable and compact representation of a validated transaction, enabling sharing with third parties for various purposes such as dispute resolution or auditing.

#### Key Features:

1. **Compact Representation:** Proof Cards are designed to be small in size, making them easy to share and store.
2. **Verifiable Authenticity:** Proof Cards can be verified by any entity possessing the Verifier, ensuring their authenticity and integrity.
3. **Privacy Preservation:** Similar to cryptographic receipts, Proof Cards do not disclose sensitive transaction details.
4. **Flexible Usage:** Proof Cards can be used for various purposes, such as proof of purchase, dispute resolution, or auditing.

## Using the Verifier and Proof Cards

To use the Verifier and Proof Cards, follow these steps:

1. Generate a cryptographic receipt by following the instructions provided in the [Cryptographic Receipts 2 documentation](cryptographic-receipts-1.md).
2. Use the generated cryptographic receipt as input for the Verifier to validate its authenticity and integrity.
3. Upon successful verification, obtain a Proof Card from the Verifier.
4. Share the Proof Card with third parties as needed.
