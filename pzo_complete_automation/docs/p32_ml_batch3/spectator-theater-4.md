Spectator Theater 4 (ST4) for ML Companions Batch 3
=====================================================

Spectator Theater 4 (ST4) is a powerful tool designed for the third batch of ML Companions. It allows users to visualize and interact with machine learning models in an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.

Installation
------------

To install ST4, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
-----

After installation, you can use ST4 as follows:

1. Prepare your machine learning model and save it in a compatible format (e.g., .h5 for Keras models).
2. Run the `spectator_theater.py` script with your model file as an argument:

```bash
python spectator_theater.py model.h5
```

This will launch the Spectator Theater interface, where you can visualize and interact with your machine learning model.

Features
--------

* Interactive visualization of machine learning models
