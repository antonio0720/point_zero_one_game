Title: ML Companions Batch 3 - Counterparty Freeze-10

## Overview

The Counterparty Freeze-10 is the tenth experiment in the third batch of the ML Companions project. This document outlines the objectives, methodology, and results of this particular experiment.

## Objectives

The main objective of the Counterparty Freeze-10 experiment is to investigate the impact of a sudden counterparty freeze on various ML models' performance and behavior in a trading environment.

## Methodology

1. Selection of participating ML models based on their performance and diversity in previous experiments.
2. Setup of a simulated trading environment identical to that used in previous experiments, ensuring parity across all models.
3. Introduction of a sudden counterparty freeze scenario where the selected counterparty was no longer available for trades.
4. Observation of each model's response to the counterparty freeze, monitoring their adaptation strategies and overall performance.
5. Collection of data on each model's behavior during the experiment for further analysis and comparison.
6. Evaluation of the models' resilience, agility, and adaptability in handling sudden changes in trading conditions.

## Results

The results from the Counterparty Freeze-10 experiment will be analyzed and presented hereafter, detailing each model's performance during the counterparty freeze scenario. The findings will help us understand how these ML models respond to unexpected events and improve their design moving forward.

## Conclusion

By examining the results of the Counterparty Freeze-10 experiment, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of our ML models in challenging trading conditions. These insights will inform future improvements to enhance model robustness and adaptability, ultimately leading to better performance in real-world applications.
