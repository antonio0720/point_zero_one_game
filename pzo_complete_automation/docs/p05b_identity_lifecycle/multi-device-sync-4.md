# Identity Lifecycle & Recovery - Multi-Device Sync (Version 4)

## Overview

This document describes the fourth version of the multi-device sync feature for identity lifecycle and recovery in our system. The main goal is to ensure seamless user experience across multiple devices while maintaining secure access to user accounts.

## Key Features

1. **User Account Linking**: Allows users to link their accounts across various devices.
2. **Device Verification**: Confirms the ownership of a device during account linking.
3. **Real-time Sync**: Ensures data consistency across linked devices in real-time.
4. **Secure Data Transmission**: Utilizes secure protocols for transmitting sensitive user data.
5. **Identity Recovery**: Provides recovery options for users who have lost access to their primary device.

## Prerequisites

- A registered user account
- Internet connectivity on all devices
- Installation of the latest version of our app on all devices

## Device Linking Process

1. User initiates the linking process from their primary device.
2. The system generates a unique verification code.
3. User enters the verification code on the new device to verify ownership.
4. Account is successfully linked, and user data is synced in real-time across both devices.

## Identity Recovery

In case of a lost or stolen primary device:

1. User contacts our support team for assistance.
2. The support team verifies the user's identity using alternative methods (e.g., phone call, email, or two-factor authentication).
3. Once identity is verified, the system unlinks the primary device and allows the user to link a new one following the regular process outlined above.

## Security Measures

We employ several security measures to protect our users' data:

1. **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted during transmission and at rest.
2. **Secure Storage**: User accounts and passwords are stored securely using best practices.
3. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Encouraged for added security, MFA requires users to provide multiple forms of authentication before accessing their account.
4. **Device Verification**: Confirms the ownership of a device during account linking and prevents unauthorized access.
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: Our systems monitor user activity for suspicious behavior and take appropriate action when necessary.

## Conclusion

The fourth version of our multi-device sync feature offers users a seamless experience while maintaining a high level of security. By linking accounts across multiple devices, users can access their data from any device with ease, while the recovery process ensures they can regain access in case of emergencies.
