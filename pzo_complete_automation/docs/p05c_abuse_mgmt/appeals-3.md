# Abuse and Ban Management - Appeals-3

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for handling user appeals in the context of abuse management and bans, specifically focusing on Appeals-3 level.

## Appeals-3 Level

Appeals-3 is the final level of user appeals within our system. At this stage, an appeal has been reviewed by multiple moderators and a decision has been made. However, if there are extenuating circumstances or new evidence, users can still submit an Appeals-3 request for reconsideration.

## Process

1. **Request**: Users who wish to appeal their ban at the Appeals-3 level should fill out the designated form, providing all relevant details and any new evidence that was not previously considered.

2. **Review**: The Appeals-3 team will review the request, taking into account the provided evidence and circumstances. This process may include consultation with other moderators or team members if necessary.

3. **Decision**: Based on the review, a decision will be made and communicated to the user. The decision could result in upholding the ban, reducing the length of the ban, or lifting the ban entirely, depending on the circumstances and evidence presented.

## Note

It is important to note that decisions at this level are final and cannot typically be overturned. Users are encouraged to provide all relevant details and evidence in their initial appeals to increase the chances of a favorable outcome.
