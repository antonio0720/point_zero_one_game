Title: Monte-Carlo-2: Simulation + Fuzz Harness

## Overview

The Monte-Carlo-2 project is a comprehensive simulation and fuzz testing framework designed to ensure the robustness and reliability of complex systems. It employs a Monte Carlo methodology for generating random inputs, thereby simulating various system scenarios.

## Key Components

1. **Simulation Engine**: The heart of the Monte-Carlo-2 project, responsible for executing simulations based on user-defined models and settings.

2. **Fuzz Harness**: A tool designed to create and apply fuzz tests to the simulated system, helping to identify potential bugs or vulnerabilities.

3. **Configuration Manager**: Handles the management of simulation parameters, models, and test cases. It allows for customization and fine-tuning of the testing process.

## Usage

To utilize Monte-Carlo-2, follow these general steps:

1. Define your system model in a format supported by the framework (e.g., JSON or YAML).
2. Configure the simulation settings, such as the number of iterations, input distribution parameters, and output analysis methods.
3. Run the simulation engine to execute tests based on the defined model and configuration.
4. Apply fuzz testing using the provided fuzz harness.
5. Analyze the results, identifying any potential issues or vulnerabilities in the system under test.
