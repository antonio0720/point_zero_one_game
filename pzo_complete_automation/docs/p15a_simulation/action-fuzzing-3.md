# Action Fuzzing-3: Simulation and Fuzz Harness

## Overview
Action Fuzzing-3 is a comprehensive simulation and fuzz testing framework designed to find security vulnerabilities, bugs, and weaknesses in software systems by subjecting them to extensive and unpredictable inputs (fuzzing).

## Components
### Simulation Layer
1. **State Manager**: Maintains the internal state of the system being tested.
2. **Action Executor**: Performs the actions defined in the configuration file.
3. **Event Generator**: Creates events based on the current state and actions.
4. **Input Provider**: Generates random inputs to feed into the system.
5. **Observer**: Monitors the system for errors, crashes, or other abnormal behaviors.

### Fuzz Harness Layer
1. **Mutation Engine**: Modifies the input provided by Input Provider to create new, unpredictable inputs.
2. **Test Case Manager**: Tracks and manages test cases throughout the fuzzing process.
3. **Scoreboard**: Ranks test cases based on their effectiveness in discovering bugs or vulnerabilities.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Automatically adjusts the mutation strategy based on the results observed by the Observer.

## Usage
To use Action Fuzzing-3, follow these steps:

1. Configure the simulation layer by defining the state manager, action executor, event generator, input provider, observer, and any other necessary components.
2. Implement the fuzz harness layer by providing a mutation engine, test case manager, scoreboard, and feedback loop.
3. Initialize the framework with the configured simulation and fuzz harness layers.
4. Start the fuzzing process by feeding the system with the initial inputs generated by the Input Provider.
5. Observe the system for errors, crashes, or other abnormal behaviors reported by the Observer.
6. Adjust the mutation strategy based on the results observed by the feedback loop.
