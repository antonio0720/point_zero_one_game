# Fairness Validation - Version 4

## Overview

This document details the fourth iteration of the Fairness Validation simulation and fuzz harness implementation. This version aims to improve upon previous iterations by addressing identified issues and implementing new features for enhanced fairness validation in complex systems.

## Key Features

1. **Improved Algorithm Design**: The algorithm used for detecting unfairness has been refined, leading to more accurate results and reduced false positives/negatives.

2. **Expanded Data Coverage**: Support for additional data types and formats has been added, making the harness more versatile and applicable to a wider range of systems.

3. **Enhanced Performance**: Optimizations have been made to improve the speed and efficiency of the simulation, reducing runtime and improving overall user experience.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: A revamped user interface offers a more intuitive and streamlined process for setting up simulations and interpreting results.

5. **Detailed Reporting**: Extensive reporting capabilities have been implemented to provide clear, actionable insights into the fairness of complex systems.
