# Security Hardening - SAST-12

## Overview

Security Assessment and Testing (SAST) guideline 12 focuses on enhancing security by applying specific hardening techniques to the system or application. These techniques help reduce attack surfaces, making it more difficult for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities.

## Key Concepts

- **Least Privilege Principle**: A user or process should only be granted the minimum level of access necessary to complete its intended tasks.
- **Secure Default Configuration**: Applications and systems should be configured with secure defaults to minimize potential security risks during deployment.
- **Hardening Guidelines**: A set of recommendations that, when applied, help increase the security posture of a system or application.

## SAST-12 Recommendations

1. Apply least privilege principle by limiting user privileges and permissions according to their roles.
2. Configure applications with secure default settings upon installation.
3. Implement hardening guidelines provided by the application vendor, operating system provider, or security best practices.
4. Disable unnecessary services, features, and modules to reduce attack surfaces.
5. Regularly update and patch the system/application to address known vulnerabilities.
6. Enforce strong password policies for user accounts and enable multi-factor authentication where possible.
7. Implement logging and monitoring systems to detect and respond to security incidents effectively.
8. Limit network access to essential services only, using firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) as needed.
9. Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms.
10. Regularly review security hardening measures and update them according to changes in the system or application environment.
