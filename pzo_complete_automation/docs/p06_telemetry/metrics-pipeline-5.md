Title: Telemetry Spine - Metrics Pipeline-5

## Overview

The Metrics Pipeline-5 is a crucial component of the Telemetry Spine, designed to process and analyze telemetry data in real-time. This document provides an overview of its functionalities, architecture, and usage.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Responsible for collecting and preprocessing raw telemetry data from various sources.
2. **Data Processing Layer**: Performs advanced analytics on the preprocessed data to extract valuable insights.
3. **Storage Layer**: Persists the processed data for further analysis, visualization, and archiving purposes.
4. **Analysis Engine**: Analyzes the stored data using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends.
5. **Alerting System**: Generates alerts based on predefined thresholds or anomalous data patterns detected by the Analysis Engine.
6. **User Interface (UI)**: Provides a user-friendly dashboard to visualize the processed data, monitor alerts, and configure system settings.

## Key Features

1. Real-time Data Processing: Enables instantaneous analysis of incoming telemetry data for immediate insights.
2. Advanced Analytics: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to uncover hidden patterns and trends in the data.
