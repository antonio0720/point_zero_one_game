6. **Scenario Analysis**: Simulates various market scenarios, such as bear markets, bull markets, or recessions, to evaluate how different portfolios perform under varying conditions. This helps investors make informed decisions based on potential outcomes.
7. **Backtesting**: Enables users to test investment strategies using historical data to assess their performance before implementing them in the real world. This can help minimize losses and improve overall portfolio returns.
8. **Real-Time Data Integration**: Integrates with multiple data sources, including stock exchanges, financial databases, and news APIs, to provide up-to-date information on asset prices, market trends, and economic indicators.
