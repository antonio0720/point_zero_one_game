# Advanced Co-op - Escrow Milestones 3

## Overview

The Escrow Milestones 3 mechanism is a feature within the advanced cooperation system, designed to facilitate secure and controlled funding for long-term projects. This document provides an overview of the process, requirements, and steps involved in using this feature.

## Prerequisites

- All parties involved must have completed the [Advanced Co-op Onboarding](onboarding.md) process.
- The project must be long-term and require significant funding.
- The parties should agree on the milestones, deliverables, and deadlines before initiating the Escrow Milestones 3 process.

## Process

1. **Project Proposal**: The project owner submits a detailed proposal outlining the project's objectives, deliverables, timeline, and budget to all participating parties.

2. **Milestone Definition**: The parties negotiate and agree on specific milestones, deadlines, and associated payments for each milestone.

3. **Escrow Account Setup**: A dedicated escrow account is set up to hold the funds for the project. All parties involved must approve the escrow account setup.

4. **Funding**: The funding parties deposit the agreed-upon amount into the escrow account.

5. **Milestone Completion**: The project owner completes each milestone within the specified deadlines and submits evidence of completion to all parties.

6. **Payment Release**: Upon approval from all parties, the funds for the completed milestone are released from the escrow account to the project owner.

7. **Repeat Steps 5 and 6**: This process is repeated for each subsequent milestone until the project is complete.

## Best Practices

- Clearly define the deliverables and deadlines for each milestone.
- Use a third-party escrow service for added security.
- Maintain open communication and transparency among all parties throughout the process.
- Have a contingency plan in case of project delays or unforeseen circumstances.
