# ML Companions Batch 2: Hardcore-Integrity-19

## Overview

The **Hardcore-Integrity-19** project is part of the ML Companions Batch 2 series, focusing on developing advanced machine learning models with a strong emphasis on data integrity and security.

## Project Details

### Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and secure machine learning model that can handle large volumes of data while maintaining high levels of accuracy and minimal data loss or corruption.

### Scope

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Implement efficient techniques for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
2. **Model Development**: Develop and train advanced machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees.
3. **Security Measures**: Implement secure data storage solutions and encryption methods to protect sensitive data during preprocessing, training, and deployment phases.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Analyze the performance of the developed models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC-ROC).
5. **Model Optimization**: Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance and reduce overfitting or underfitting issues.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained models in a secure environment such as a cloud service or an on-premises server.
7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the model's performance and make adjustments as necessary to maintain its accuracy over time.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Python programming language and machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch.
- Knowledge of data preprocessing techniques and common machine learning algorithms.
- Understanding of encryption methods and secure data storage solutions.
