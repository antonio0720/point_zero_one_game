# ML Companions Batch 2 - Faction Sponsorship-17

## Overview

This document outlines the details of ML Companions Batch 2 - Faction Sponsorship-17.

## Introduction

Faction Sponsorship-17 is a part of ML Companions Batch 2, a series of projects aimed at fostering collaboration between machine learning researchers and various factions for the purpose of advancing AI technology.

## Objective

The objective of Faction Sponsorship-17 is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the success rate of proposed AI projects within the sponsoring faction.

## Scope

1. Data Collection: Gather historical data related to successful and unsuccessful AI projects within the sponsoring faction.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data for use in machine learning models.
3. Model Development: Develop and train machine learning models that can predict the success rate of proposed AI projects.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the developed models and select the best-performing model.
5. Integration: Integrate the selected model into a user-friendly interface for use by the sponsoring faction.
6. Deployment: Deploy the integrated system within the sponsoring faction for regular usage.

## Timeline

The project timeline is as follows:

1. Data Collection: Week 1 - Week 2
2. Data Preprocessing: Week 3 - Week 4
3. Model Development: Week 5 - Week 8
4. Evaluation: Week 9
5. Integration: Week 10
6. Deployment: Week 11 - Week 12

## Roles and Responsibilities

1. Data Scientist: Collect, preprocess, and analyze data for model development.
2. Machine Learning Engineer: Develop and train machine learning models.
3. UI/UX Designer: Design the user-friendly interface for the integrated system.
4. Project Manager: Oversee the project timeline, ensure deliverables are met, and manage communication between team members.

## Deliverables

1. Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
2. Machine learning models with their respective evaluation metrics.
3. Integrated user-friendly system for predicting AI project success rates.
4. Deployed system within the sponsoring faction.
5. Report detailing the entire process, findings, and future improvements.
