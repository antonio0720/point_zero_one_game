Faction Sponsorship - Batch 2
=============================

Overview
--------

Faction Sponsorship is a machine learning (ML) project that aims to predict the sponsors of various factions in a strategic game. This batch represents the second iteration of the project, built upon learnings from the first batch and incorporating additional improvements.

Data
----

The dataset for this project consists of data related to factions, their attributes, and their previous sponsors. The dataset is pre-processed and ready for immediate use in machine learning algorithms.

Models
------

Several ML models are employed to predict the sponsor of a given faction. These include:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forests
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6. Naive Bayes Classifier
7. Neural Networks
8. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
9. LightGBM
10. XGBoost

Evaluation Metrics
-------------------

To evaluate the performance of each model, we will use the following metrics:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1 Score
5. Confusion Matrix
6. ROC Curve and AUC-ROC
7. Classification Report
8. Cohens Kappa Statistic

Results and Analysis
--------------------

The results of each model will be presented with their respective metrics, and a thorough analysis will be conducted to determine the optimal ML model for predicting faction sponsors.

Conclusion
----------

Upon successful completion of this project, we aim to provide a robust and accurate ML solution for predicting faction sponsorships in strategic games. This can aid developers in creating more engaging and immersive gaming experiences for their players.

Future Work
------------

Further work on this project will focus on addressing potential limitations, improving the model's performance, and exploring alternative approaches to enhance the accuracy of faction sponsorship predictions.
