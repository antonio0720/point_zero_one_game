# Eval Harness 10

Eval Harness 10 is a comprehensive evaluation framework for machine learning models, designed to provide a robust and efficient way to test and compare model performance across various scenarios. This document provides an overview of the key components, usage, and configuration options of Eval Harness 10.

## Key Components

1. **ModelRunner**: The central component responsible for executing and managing multiple models in parallel. It ensures that each model is evaluated under identical conditions, promoting fairness and consistency in the evaluation process.

2. **Evaluator**: A module responsible for calculating metrics based on the predictions generated by the ModelRunner. Eval Harness 10 supports a variety of commonly used evaluation metrics across different domains such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and more.

3. **ScenarioManager**: Manages multiple evaluation scenarios, allowing users to test models under diverse conditions like different datasets, data splits, hyperparameters, or hardware configurations.

4. **Reporter**: Generates summary reports detailing the performance of each model across all evaluated scenarios. The Reporter supports exporting results in various formats including HTML, CSV, and JSON.

## Usage

To utilize Eval Harness 10, follow these general steps:

1. Define your models, evaluation scenarios, and desired metrics within the configuration file.
2. Initialize the Eval Harness 10 instance with your configuration settings.
3. Start the execution of the specified scenarios by calling the run method on the initialized Eval Harness 10 object.
4. Once the evaluation is complete, access the generated reports through the Reporter interface.

## Configuration Options

The configuration file for Eval Harness 10 is a YAML file that allows users to specify various settings such as:

- Model definitions and paths
- Dataset locations and configurations
- Data preprocessing pipelines (optional)
- Metrics to evaluate each model's performance
- Hyperparameters for each model
- Scenario specific configurations (e.g., number of epochs, batch size)
- Hardware resources to allocate for parallelized evaluations

## Advanced Features

Eval Harness 10 offers additional features to enhance the evaluation process:

- **Performance Profiling**: Capture detailed performance metrics such as training and inference times, memory usage, and GPU utilization.
- **Model Comparison Visualizations**: Generate interactive visualizations comparing model performances across various dimensions like accuracy, speed, and resource consumption.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration**: Easily integrate Eval Harness 10 with popular CI/CD platforms like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Travis CI to automate model evaluation as part of your pipeline.
