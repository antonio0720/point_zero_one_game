# PvP-ghosts-8: Matchmaking and Sessions

## Overview

This document outlines the matchmaking and session management for the PvP-ghosts-8 game mode.

## Matchmaking

The matchmaking system in PvP-ghosts-8 is designed to ensure fair and balanced matches for all players. The system takes into account various factors such as player skill level, connection quality, and game preference to create a suitable match.

### Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM)

The SBMM in PvP-ghosts-8 ranks players based on their performance in previous matches. This rank is then used to find opponents of similar skill levels for an optimal gaming experience.

#### Rank Calculation

Player ranks are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes into account various factors, such as:

1. Win/Loss ratio
2. Kills per match
3. Time spent in the game
4. Average position on the scoreboard
5. Performance in specific game modes and maps

#### Rank Adjustment

Player ranks are adjusted after each match based on their performance and the performance of their opponents. Winning against higher-ranked opponents will result in a larger rank increase, while losing to lower-ranked opponents will cause a smaller rank decrease.

### Connection Quality Matchmaking (CQM)

To ensure a smooth gaming experience, the matchmaking system also considers players' connection quality. Players with stable connections are more likely to be matched with other players who have similar network conditions.

#### Connection Quality Assessment

The game assesses players' connection quality by measuring ping times, packet loss, and jitter during the matchmaking process. Players with poor connection quality may be placed in separate lobbies or temporarily excluded from matchmaking to prevent negative experiences for other players.

### Game Preference Matchmaking (GPM)

Players can specify their preferred game modes and maps within the matchmaking settings. The system will try to accommodate these preferences when creating matches, but they are not guaranteed due to the need for balancing player skill levels and connection qualities.

## Session Management

Once a match is created, players join a session where they can communicate with each other, adjust their settings, and start playing.

### Lobby

The lobby is the waiting area where players gather before a match begins. Players can use this time to communicate with teammates or opponents, check their loadouts, and review the game mode and map details.

#### Ready Check

Before a match starts, players are prompted to perform a ready check to ensure that all participants are aware of the impending start and have prepared accordingly. If a player fails to respond to the ready check after a certain time, they may be automatically kicked from the session.

### In-Game Settings

Players can adjust various settings during a match, such as:

1. Game sensitivity
2. Resolution and graphics quality
3. Audio settings (volume levels for various sounds)
4. Controller layout and bindings
5. Video settings (field of view, motion blur, etc.)

### Match Results

At the end of a match, players are presented with a summary of the results, including:

1. Final score
2. Player statistics (kills, deaths, assists, etc.)
3. Rank points earned or lost
4. Performance compared to teammates and opponents
5. Option to report toxic or cheating behavior from other players
6. Opportunity to join a new match or return to the lobby
