# Co-op Tables (Version 12)

This document outlines the details of matchmaking and session management for the cooperative game mode in version 12 of our game.

## Matchmaking

### Player Search

During the matchmaking process, players can search for games based on specific criteria such as game type, difficulty level, and player count. The system will prioritize matches that best meet the player's preferences.

### Auto-Match

If a player does not specify any criteria or waits too long for a suitable match, they will be auto-matched with available games. In this case, players may be placed in games that do not perfectly align with their specified preferences but ensure a quicker matchmaking process.

## Sessions

### Session Creation

A game session can be created by any player within the allowed limit of sessions per account. The session creator is responsible for choosing the game type, difficulty level, and other settings. Once created, the session becomes visible to other players in the matchmaking pool.

### Joining a Session

Players searching for games or auto-matched can join an open session. If multiple players attempt to join a full session simultaneously, the system will prioritize joining based on factors such as player skill level and connection quality.

### In-Progress Sessions

Once a game is in progress, it cannot be joined by additional players. However, if a player leaves during the game, their spot can be filled by another player from the matchmaking pool.

### Session Settings

Players can adjust various settings within a session such as voice chat options, in-game text chat, and time limits for each round. These settings can be modified at any time during the game unless otherwise specified.

## Conclusion

In version 12 of our cooperative game mode, players can enjoy a seamless matchmaking experience that caters to their preferences while also ensuring quick access to games. The session management system allows for customizable settings and dynamic player joining, enhancing overall gameplay and engagement.
