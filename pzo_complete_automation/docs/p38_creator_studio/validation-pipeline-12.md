### 1. Unit Testing

- Verify individual components and functions within the Creator Studio independently.
- Utilize automated testing tools to run unit tests quickly and efficiently.

### 2. Integration Testing

- Ensure that components work well together in the context of the Creator Studio.
- Identify any potential issues caused by the interaction between different parts of the system.

### 3. Functional Testing

- Evaluate the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the Creator Studio.
- Validate that all features are working as intended, meeting design requirements, and delivering an enjoyable user experience.

### 4. Performance Testing

- Assess the speed and scalability of the Creator Studio under various loads.
- Ensure that the system can handle multiple users or high traffic without performance degradation.
