# Scenario Builder (Version 14) in Creator Studio

This document outlines the features and functionalities of the Scenario Builder in version 14 of Creator Studio.

## Overview

The Scenario Builder is a powerful tool within Creator Studio that allows users to design complex interactive experiences by connecting various events, actions, and conditions. This guide will help you understand how to use it effectively.

## Key Features

1. **Event Triggers**: Events are the starting points for scenarios. They can be user-triggered (such as a button click) or system-triggered (such as time elapsed).

2. **Conditions**: Conditions determine when an action should occur based on specific criteria, such as checking if a variable has a certain value or if a user's choice matches a specific option.

3. **Actions**: Actions are the tasks that happen in response to events and conditions being met. They can range from displaying text, changing variables, playing sounds, to navigating to different scenes.

4. **Flow Control**: Scenario Builder offers various flow control elements like 'If-Else' statements, loops, and switches to manage the sequence of events and actions in your scenario.

5. **Visual Editor**: The visual editor provides an intuitive interface for designing scenarios, allowing users to easily connect events, conditions, and actions using a drag-and-drop system.
