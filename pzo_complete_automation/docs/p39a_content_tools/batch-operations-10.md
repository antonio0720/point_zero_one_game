Batch Operations (v10)
======================

This document describes the Batch Operations feature in our internal content authoring tools, version 10.

Overview
--------

Batch Operations provide a way to perform multiple operations on a set of items simultaneously. This can greatly increase productivity when dealing with large numbers of items.

### Supported Operation Types

- Create: Create new items based on a template.
- Update: Modify existing items according to specific rules.
- Delete: Remove selected items from the system.

### Limitations

- Batch Operations can only be applied to items of the same type (e.g., all articles or all products).
- Complex rules for updating items may require manual review and adjustment.

Usage
-----

1. Select one or more items in the desired category.
2. Click on the "Batch Operations" button.
3. Choose an operation type from the dropdown menu.
4. Configure the operation settings according to your needs.
5. Click "Apply" to execute the Batch Operation.

Best Practices
--------------

- Always test Batch Operations on a small sample of items before applying them to large sets.
- Use templates for creating new items to ensure consistency across multiple operations.
- Be cautious when updating existing items, as complex rules can lead to unexpected results.
- Regularly review and update your Batch Operation rules to reflect changes in content requirements.
