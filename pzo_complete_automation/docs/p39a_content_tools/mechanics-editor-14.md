Mechanics Editor 14
==================

Mechanics Editor 14 is an internal content authoring tool designed for creating and managing game mechanics within the game development process. This version offers enhanced functionality, improved user interface, and increased efficiency in mechanic design.

Key Features:
-------------

1. **Visual Mechanic Designer**: Create and visualize game mechanics using a drag-and-drop interface. Customizable nodes and connections make it easy to design complex mechanics quickly.
2. **Behavior Scripting**: Write scripts for mechanic behaviors using a built-in scripting language. The editor supports multiple scripting languages, including Lua and C#.
3. **Version Control Integration**: Easily integrate with popular version control systems like Git and Perforce to manage changes, collaborate with other developers, and track the history of your game mechanics.
4. **Prototyping Tools**: Includes a suite of tools for rapid prototyping, such as a level editor, animation timeline, and event system.
5. **Collaboration Features**: Facilitates collaboration between team members with real-time multiplayer editing, commenting, and review functionality.
6. **Performance Analysis**: Monitor the performance of your mechanics using built-in profiling tools, helping you identify and fix bottlenecks in your game's mechanics.
7. **Integration with Game Engines**: Seamlessly integrates with popular game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine to ease the process of implementing designed mechanics into games.
