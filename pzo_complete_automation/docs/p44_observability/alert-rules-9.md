Alert Rules (Level 9) for Observability + SRE
==============================================

In the realm of Observability and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), alert rules play a crucial role in maintaining system health by identifying anomalous behavior. Here's an outline of level 9 alert rules, which represent the most severe conditions that require immediate attention:

### Level 9 Alert Rules

1. **Unplanned Major Incident**: Alerts generated when a major incident occurs unexpectedly, affecting critical services or resources. The incident should be resolved within a short timeframe to minimize user impact and potential data loss.

2. **Data Loss**: Alerts raised due to loss of data either temporarily or permanently. This could be caused by hardware failures, software bugs, or network issues that compromise the integrity of data storage systems.

3. **System Compromise**: Alerts indicating a security breach or system compromise. These alerts signal unauthorized access to sensitive data, malware infections, or DDoS attacks on the system infrastructure.

4. **Catastrophic Failure**: Alerts triggered by events causing catastrophic failures, such as power outages, natural disasters, or complete system shutdowns due to unforeseen circumstances. These alerts require immediate attention from the SRE team to ensure system recovery and minimize downtime.

5. **Data Privacy Breach**: Alerts generated when there is an unauthorized disclosure of personal data, resulting in potential privacy violations. These breaches must be addressed promptly to prevent further data exposure and ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

6. **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Alerts alerting the SRE team of potential or actual non-compliance with industry standards, regulations, or legal requirements. Immediate action is required to rectify any identified issues and maintain system integrity and regulatory compliance.

7. **Financial Loss**: Alerts associated with significant financial losses, such as revenue loss due to system downtime or transaction failures, or excessive costs resulting from increased resource consumption or inefficient use of resources.

8. **Vendor Outage**: Alerts related to third-party service providers experiencing outages that affect critical aspects of the system. In these cases, it's essential to maintain open communication with vendors and develop contingency plans to minimize the impact on users.

9. **High Priority Escalations**: Alerts marked as high priority escalations, which require immediate attention from senior SRE personnel or relevant stakeholders due to their severe nature or potential long-term implications for the system's health and reliability.
