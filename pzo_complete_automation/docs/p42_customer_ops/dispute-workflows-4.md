# Customer Ops Automation - Dispute Workflows 4

## Overview

This document outlines the fourth version of the customer dispute workflow automation within our system. The primary objective is to provide a streamlined process for handling customer disputes, enhancing efficiency and improving user experience.

## Dispute Workflow Process

### 1. Dispute Creation

Disputes can be initiated by customers through various channels such as email, phone, or web portal. The system automatically assigns each dispute to a dedicated Dispute Resolution Team member based on specific criteria (e.g., dispute type, team availability).

### 2. Initial Assessment

Upon receiving a dispute, the assigned team member performs an initial assessment to determine the nature of the dispute and its potential resolution. This may involve reviewing relevant account information, communication with customers, or consultation with other teams.

### 3. Dispute Resolution

After the initial assessment, the team member initiates a resolution process. Depending on the dispute type, this may involve various steps such as:

- Investigation and verification of facts
- Collaboration with other teams (e.g., Billing, Compliance) for additional information or assistance
- Negotiation with the customer to reach an agreement

```

### 4. Dispute Resolution Outcome

Once a resolution is reached, the team member documents the outcome and communicates it to the customer. The system automatically updates the dispute status and records all relevant information for future reference.

### 5. Closure and Follow-up

The dispute is considered closed once both parties agree on the resolution. However, team members may follow up with customers to ensure satisfaction and gather feedback for continuous improvement of the dispute resolution process.
