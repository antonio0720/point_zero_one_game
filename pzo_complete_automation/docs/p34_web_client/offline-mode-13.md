Offline Mode (version 13) for Web Client Documentation
=========================================================

Overview
--------

The Offline Mode (version 13) for the Web Client is an essential feature that enables users to access and interact with the application even when they are not connected to the internet. This documentation will provide a comprehensive guide on how to use this feature effectively.

Activating Offline Mode
-----------------------

To activate Offline Mode, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the settings menu by clicking on your user profile picture located at the top right corner of the dashboard.
2. Select 'Settings' from the dropdown menu.
3. In the settings page, find and click on the 'Offline Mode' option.
4. Toggle the switch to enable Offline Mode.

Using Offline Mode
------------------

While using Offline Mode, you can still access and interact with most of the application's functionalities. However, here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. Data Synchronization: Any changes made while offline will be synced with the server once an internet connection is restored. It is recommended to periodically check for available updates and sync data manually if necessary.
2. Real-Time Collaboration: Offline Mode disables real-time collaboration features, meaning that other users won't see your changes in real time until you are back online.
3. Automatic Updates: The application will not automatically update while in Offline Mode. Manual updates should be performed periodically to ensure that you have the latest version of the software.
4. Offline Data Limits: Depending on the size and complexity of your data, there may be limits to how much can be stored offline. It is recommended to regularly clean up old or unnecessary data to ensure optimal performance.
5. Offline-Only Features: Some features may only be available in Offline Mode, such as accessing preloaded data sets or using specific offline tools. These features will be explicitly marked as 'Offline Only' within the application.

Troubleshooting Offline Mode Issues
------------------------------------

If you encounter any issues while using Offline Mode, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. Check your internet connection to ensure that it is stable and functioning correctly.
2. Ensure that Offline Mode is properly enabled by following the activation instructions provided above.
3. Clear your browser cache and cookies, as this may resolve issues with syncing or accessing offline content.
4. If you continue to experience issues, contact our support team for further assistance.
