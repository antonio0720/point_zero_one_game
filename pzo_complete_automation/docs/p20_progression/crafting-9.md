## Progression

### Level Requirements

To advance to level 9, a player must have reached level 8 in the crafting system and accumulated a certain amount of experience points:

- Experience Required: 500 points

### Crafting Skill Points

Upon reaching level 9, players receive 4 new skill points to enhance their crafting abilities. These points can be allocated across the following skills:

1. **Efficiency**: Increases the amount of materials gained per item crafted and reduces the time required for each craft.
2. **Quality**: Boosts the quality of items crafted, resulting in better attributes and performance.
3. **Versatility**: Expands the range of items that can be crafted, opening up access to new blueprints and recipes.
4. **Speed**: Reduces the time required to craft individual items, allowing for quicker progression and production.

### Blueprint Acquisition

New level 9 blueprints can be obtained through various means:

1. **Purchasing**: Blueprints can be bought from vendors or shops within the game world using in-game currency or other resources.
2. **Quests**: Completing specific quests or missions may reward players with new blueprints.
3. **Drops**: Defeating certain enemies or bosses may yield rare blueprint drops as loot.
4. **Trading**: Players can trade blueprints with each other through various in-game trading systems.
5. **Crafting Recipe Discovery**: By crafting lower level versions of an item, there is a chance to discover the recipe for its higher level counterpart. This method becomes increasingly rare as the difference between levels increases (e.g., it's more likely to find a level 10 blueprint from crafting a level 9 item than from crafting a level 5 item).

### Material Requirements

Level 9 crafting recipes often demand rarer and harder-to-find materials. Players should focus on gathering high-quality resources, participating in resource node events, and completing special material collection quests to ensure they have sufficient materials for their crafting endeavors.
