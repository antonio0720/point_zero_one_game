This document outlines the key features, functionalities, and integrations for Mentor Queue 3, specifically focusing on Leaderboards and Social aspects.

## Overview

Mentor Queue 3 is designed to facilitate efficient mentorship programs by providing a platform that matches mentors with mentees based on shared interests, skills, and goals. The addition of Leaderboards and Social features aim to foster friendly competition, increase user engagement, and encourage collaboration among users.

## Leaderboards

Leaderboards provide a visual representation of users' performance and achievements within the Mentor Queue 3 platform. By tracking key metrics such as activity level, participation in sessions, and knowledge sharing, users can compete against each other for recognition and rewards.

### Leaderboard Metrics

1. Activity Level: Measures the frequency and consistency of a user's interactions on the platform (e.g., posting questions, attending sessions, providing answers).
2. Session Participation: Tracks the number of mentorship sessions attended by each user.
3. Knowledge Sharing: Evaluates the quantity and quality of information shared by users through posts, comments, and session participation.
4. Mentee Progress: Monitors the progress made by mentees under a particular mentor's guidance, such as completing tasks or achieving goals set during their mentorship sessions.

### Leaderboard Types

1. Global Leaderboard: Displays the top-performing users across all categories on a global scale, encouraging healthy competition among a large user base.
2. Category-specific Leaderboards: Breaks down the leaderboard rankings by specific categories (e.g., technology, business, arts) to allow for more targeted competitions and recognition within particular interest areas.
3. Time-based Leaderboards: Offers temporary leaderboards that reset periodically, such as daily or weekly rankings, to maintain excitement and incentivize frequent participation.

## Social Integration

The integration of social features in Mentor Queue 3 aims to promote a sense of community among users by allowing them to connect, collaborate, and share their experiences.

### User Profiles

Each user will have a personalized profile page where they can showcase their accomplishments, skills, and interests. This information will help other users find potential mentors or mentees with shared goals.

### Messaging System

A built-in messaging system enables users to communicate directly with each other for private discussions, coordinating meetings, sharing resources, and building relationships beyond the scope of formal mentorship sessions.

### Forums and Discussion Boards

Forums and discussion boards serve as community spaces where users can engage in conversations on various topics related to their interests and industries. These spaces foster learning, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing among like-minded individuals.

## Conclusion

By incorporating Leaderboards and Social features into Mentor Queue 3, we aim to create a more engaging, interactive, and collaborative platform that encourages users to grow both personally and professionally through mentorship. These additions not only enhance user experience but also foster a vibrant community of lifelong learners and industry experts.
