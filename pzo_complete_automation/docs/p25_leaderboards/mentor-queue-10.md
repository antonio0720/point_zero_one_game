# Mentor Queue - 10

The Mentor Queue - 10 is a feature that enables users to join a queue for access to a mentor. The system ensures fairness by allowing up to 10 users at a time to interact with the mentor.

## How It Works

1. Users join the Mentor Queue - 10 when they have a question or need advice from the mentor.
2. Once a spot opens up (when a user leaves the queue or the time limit for each interaction expires), the next user in line is moved to the active session with the mentor.
3. The user and the mentor can engage in a discussion, ask questions, and receive advice during their allotted time.
4. After the time limit for each interaction has expired, the user is removed from the active session, and the next user in line is moved up.
5. Users who are not currently in an active session remain in the queue, waiting for their turn.

## Benefits

1. Fairness: The Mentor Queue - 10 ensures that all users have an equal chance to interact with the mentor.
2. Efficiency: By limiting the number of users in an active session, the system ensures focused and productive interactions between the mentor and each user.
3. Social Interaction: This feature fosters a sense of community by allowing users to learn from one another as they wait for their turn with the mentor.
