Mentor Queue 4: Leaderboards and Social Integration
======================================================

Mentor Queue 4 introduces a new feature set aimed at fostering community engagement, competitiveness, and knowledge sharing among users. The core of this update is the integration of leaderboards and social features to enrich the learning experience.

Leaderboards
------------

### Rankings and Rewards

Mentor Queue 4's leaderboard system tracks user progress based on various criteria such as problem solving, discussion contributions, and community engagement. The rankings are dynamic, updated in real-time, and will allow users to compete against one another for recognition and rewards.

### Leaderboard Types

The leaderboards will be segmented into multiple categories, including:

1. Problem Solving: Users who solve the most problems in a given time frame.
2. Discussion Contribution: Users who ask or answer the most questions or contribute to discussions.
3. Community Engagement: Users who actively participate in community activities and events.

### Personalized Progress Tracking

Users will be able to track their own progress on the leaderboards, receiving notifications when they move up in rankings, achieve milestones, or unlock rewards.

Social Features

### User Profiles

Every user will have a customizable profile page showcasing their achievements, contributions, and interests. Users can connect with one another through the messaging system, collaborate on problems, or simply engage in friendly competition.

### Community Forums

Mentor Queue 4 will also feature community forums where users can discuss various topics related to programming and learning. These forums will be moderated to ensure a positive and productive environment for all participants.

### Collaborative Problem-Solving

Users can work together on solving problems, sharing solutions, and learning from one another. This collaborative aspect encourages peer-to-peer learning and builds a stronger community.
