Error Taxonomy for Client Foundations (Version 3)
===============================================

This document outlines the error taxonomy for Client Foundations version 3. The taxonomy defines a standardized set of error types, their properties, and recommended handling strategies to facilitate consistent and efficient error management across various applications built using Client Foundations.

**Error Classification**
------------------------

1. **System Errors (SE)**
- System errors are generated by the system itself due to unexpected conditions or internal issues.
- Examples: Network connection errors, server downtime, and authentication failures.

2. **Application Errors (AE)**
- Application errors occur within the application logic and are often caused by user input validation issues or business rule violations.
- Examples: Invalid input data, out-of-stock items, and unavailable services.

3. **User Experience Errors (UXE)**
- User experience errors are generated as a result of confusing UI designs, misleading instructions, or other usability issues that affect the user's interaction with the application.
- Examples: Broken links, missing labels, and unclear error messages.

**Error Properties**
--------------------

1. **Error Code (EC)**
- A unique identifier for each error type, helping developers quickly identify and handle specific errors.

2. **Error Message (EM)**
- A human-readable description of the error, providing users with a clear understanding of the issue.

3. **Additional Information (AI)**
- Additional data or context that may be useful for diagnosing and resolving the error, such as stack traces or specific input values.

**Error Handling Strategies**
------------------------------

1. **Client-side Error Handling**
- Handle errors on the client side whenever possible to provide users with immediate feedback and improve application performance.

2. **Logging Errors**
- Log errors for analysis and debugging purposes, ensuring developers can identify and resolve issues efficiently.

3. **Graceful Error Handling**
- Provide graceful error handling by offering users alternative actions or suggestions when encountering an error to minimize the impact on their workflow.

4. **User Notification**
- Inform users of errors through appropriate notification mechanisms, such as alerts or emails, depending on the context and severity of the issue.

5. **Error Reporting**
- Enable users to report errors to developers for future improvements and fixes in subsequent releases.
