Error Taxonomy for Client Foundations
===================================

This document outlines the taxonomy of errors that may occur within the context of the Client Foundations. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of potential issues, their causes, and suggested resolutions.

**Client-Side Errors**
-----------------------

### 1. Connection Errors

#### 1.1 Network Connectivity Issues

* Cause: Inability to establish or maintain a stable network connection with the server.
* Resolution: Check internet connectivity, restart the application, or try using a different network.

#### 1.2 Authentication Errors

* Cause: Invalid credentials provided during login or authorization failure.
* Resolution: Double-check entered credentials and ensure they are correct. If issues persist, contact support for assistance.

### 2. Application Errors

#### 2.1 Parse Errors

* Cause: Incorrectly formatted data sent to the server or received from it.
* Resolution: Check the format of your data and make sure it adheres to the specified standards before submitting it.

#### 2.2 API Usage Errors

* Cause: Improper usage of APIs, such as incorrect method calls, invalid parameters, or unsupported features.
* Resolution: Review the API documentation for correct usage and consult with a developer if necessary.

**Server-Side Errors**
-----------------------

### 1. Connectivity Issues

#### 1.1 Server Downtime

* Cause: The server is temporarily unavailable or down for maintenance.
* Resolution: Try again later, as the issue should resolve itself once the server is back online.

#### 1.2 Network Congestion

* Cause: High traffic on the network may cause slow response times or timeouts.
* Resolution: Wait a few minutes and try your request again. If issues persist, contact support for assistance.

### 2. Application Errors

#### 2.1 Data Corruption Errors

* Cause: Incorrect data storage or manipulation on the server's side.
* Resolution: The development team will need to address this issue and resolve any data corruption that may have occurred.

#### 2.2 System Overload Errors

* Cause: The server is experiencing high load, causing slow response times or timeouts.
* Resolution: Contact the support team or system administrators for assistance in addressing the overload.
