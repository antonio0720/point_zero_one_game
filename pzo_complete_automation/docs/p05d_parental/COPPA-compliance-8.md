# COPPA Compliance - Parental Controls and Consent (v05d)

This document outlines the procedures and guidelines for ensuring compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regarding parental controls and consent in our application.

## 1. Overview

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a federal law in the United States that imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services that are directed to children under 13, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13.

## 2. Defining Users

In the context of this document, a "child" refers to any individual under 13 years of age, while an "adult" is anyone who is at least 13 years old.

## 3. User Registration and Account Creation

### 3.1 Age Verification

At the time of registration, users will be prompted to provide their date of birth. Our system will verify if the user is under 13 years old. If the age is below 13, the registration process for children will initiate the COPPA-compliant process as described in Section 4.

### 3.2 Adult Users Creating Accounts for Children

Adult users may create accounts on behalf of children under 13. In such cases, they will be required to provide their own personal information and agree to this Privacy Policy and the COPPA-compliant terms during the account creation process.

## 4. COPPA Compliant Process for Children Under 13

When a child is detected during the registration process, our system will prompt the adult user to:

1. Provide their own contact information (such as email address or phone number) for verification purposes.
2. Acknowledge that they are the child's parent or legal guardian.
3. Consent to the collection and use of their child's personal data by checking a consent box.
4. Agree to the COPPA-compliant terms outlined in our Privacy Policy.
5. Verify their identity through an email or text message containing a verification code.
6. Complete the registration process on behalf of the child, creating the account and granting parental controls as necessary.

## 5. Parental Controls

Parents and guardians will have access to various parental control features within their account:

- Monitoring of their child's activity within the application.
- Modification of privacy settings for their child's account.
- Management of content filters to control what their child can access.
- Ability to view and manage any personal information associated with their child's account.

## 6. Data Protection and Privacy

We are committed to protecting the privacy of all users, especially children under 13. Our Privacy Policy outlines our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal data, including how we comply with COPPA regulations.

## 7. Reporting Violations or Concerns

If you believe that our application has collected personal information from a child under 13 without first obtaining the necessary parental consent or if you have any other concerns about our COPPA compliance, please contact us at [support@ourapp.com](mailto:support@ourapp.com).
