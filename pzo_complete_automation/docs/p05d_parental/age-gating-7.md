# Age-Gating (version 7)

This document outlines the Age-Gating protocol version 7 for parental controls and user consent, applicable to our platform.

## Overview

Age-gating is a mechanism used to prevent children under a certain age from accessing or using certain services or content. It serves as a means of protecting minors while ensuring compliance with various laws and regulations regarding online child protection.

### Age Verification Methods

We employ the following methods for age verification:

1. **Date of Birth (DoB) Validation:** Users are required to input their date of birth during registration or account setup. Our system checks this information against a predefined minimum age limit.

2. **Third-Party Age Verification Services:** We may partner with third-party services that can verify the user's age through various means, such as ID scanning and verification.

3. **Parental Consent:** For users under the defined age threshold, parental consent is required before allowing access to the platform or its features. This can be obtained via email confirmation or other secure methods.

### Age Threshold

The minimum age limit for using our services varies based on regional regulations. Users from regions with a lower age threshold will still need to meet this higher standard to comply with our global policy.

### Enforcement and Penalties

Users who provide false information during the age-gating process may face account suspension or termination, as well as potential legal consequences.

### Review and Updates

This Age-Gating protocol is subject to periodic review and updates based on changes in laws, regulations, and industry best practices. Users are encouraged to regularly check this document for any updates or modifications.
