# COPPA Compliance for Parental Controls and Consent (Version 3)

This document outlines the third version of our compliance measures for the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regarding parental controls and consent.

## Introduction

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a law in the United States that requires website operators to obtain parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13 years of age. This document details our strategies for ensuring COPPA compliance in relation to parental controls and consent.

## Parental Controls Overview

Parental controls are features designed to help parents manage their children's online activities. Our platform offers the following parental control options:

1. Content filters: To block or restrict access to specific types of content.
2. Time limits: To set limitations on the amount of time spent online each day.
3. Activity monitoring: To allow parents to view their children's online activities.
4. Communication controls: To manage who their children can communicate with online.

## Consent Process

### Collection of Personal Information

When collecting personal information, our platform will use age verification methods to determine whether the user is under 13 years old. If a user appears to be under 13, we will prompt them to provide verifiable parental consent (VPCC) before proceeding with data collection.

### Verifiable Parental Consent (VPCC)

To obtain VPCC, we utilize a multi-step process:

1. Email confirmation: We send an email to the parent containing instructions and a link for granting consent.
2. Age verification: The parent is prompted to verify their child's age and confirm that they are the child's parent or legal guardian.
3. Consent form: The parent completes and submits a COPPA-compliant consent form, which includes details about data collection, use, and disclosure practices.
4. Record keeping: We maintain records of the consent process, including the date, method used, and any supporting documentation provided by the parent.

## Revision History

### Version 3 (Current)
- Improved age verification methods to better identify users under 13 years old.
- Simplified VPCC email confirmation process with clearer instructions.
- Enhanced consent form to provide more detailed information about data practices and privacy protections.
- Implemented secure record keeping procedures for maintaining consent records.
