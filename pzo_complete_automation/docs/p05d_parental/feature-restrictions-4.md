# Feature Restrictions (Version 4) for Parental Controls

## Overview

This document outlines the fourth version of our Parental Controls feature restrictions, which aim to provide parents with tools to manage their children's online activities and protect them from inappropriate content.

## New Features and Changes

### 1. Expanded Content Categories Filtering

Version 4 introduces more detailed content categories filtering. Parents can now filter content based on:

- Age appropriateness (such as preschool, elementary, middle school, high school, and adult)
- Topics (such as education, entertainment, sports, news, etc.)
- Time of day (access to certain content can be restricted during specific hours)

### 2. Enhanced Social Media Monitoring

Version 4 includes an improved social media monitoring feature, allowing parents to monitor their children's interactions on popular social media platforms more effectively.

### 3. Location Tracking and Geofencing

Parents can now enable location tracking and set up geofences to receive notifications when their child enters or leaves designated areas. This feature helps keep track of the child's whereabouts for safety purposes.

### 4. Daily Time Limits per Application

Version 4 introduces daily time limits per application, allowing parents to control how much time their children spend on specific apps each day.

## Known Limitations and Workarounds

### 1. Platform Compatibility Issues

Some features may not be compatible with certain devices or platforms. We recommend checking the compatibility list before setting up Parental Controls.

### 2. Potential for bypassing restrictions

While our Parental Controls feature aims to minimize the chances of children bypassing restrictions, it is essential for parents to maintain open communication with their children about online safety and responsible internet use.

## Upcoming Enhancements

We are continuously working on improving our Parental Controls features based on user feedback and emerging technology trends. Some upcoming enhancements include:

- Advanced AI algorithms for content filtering and monitoring
- Voice assistant integration for easy control of Parental Control settings
- Customizable alerts and notifications for parents
