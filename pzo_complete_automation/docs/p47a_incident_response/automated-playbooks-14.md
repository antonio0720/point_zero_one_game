## Overview

This document outlines the version 14 of the Security Incident Response (SIR) automated playbooks for our organization. These playbooks are designed to provide a standardized and efficient response to security incidents, utilizing automation to reduce human error and improve speed.

## Scope

These playbooks cover the following types of security incidents:

- Network intrusions
- Malware infections
- Data breaches
- Phishing attacks
- Unauthorized access

## Playbook Updates - Version 14

### Incident Classification and Prioritization

- Improved incident classification algorithm for faster and more accurate categorization of incidents.
- Introduced a new prioritization system based on the potential impact and urgency of each incident.

### Automated Containment Actions

- Enhanced containment actions to include network segmentation, isolation of infected hosts, and disabling of potentially compromised services.

### Incident Investigation and Analysis

- Integrated threat intelligence feeds for better understanding of the threat landscape and potential attack vectors.
- New forensic analysis tools to aid in identifying the root cause and extent of the incident.

### Communication and Reporting

- Improved communication templates for easier and more consistent reporting to stakeholders.
- Added options for real-time updates during the incident response process.

## Implementation and Testing

The playbooks will be rolled out across all relevant systems over the next quarter. A series of tests will be conducted to ensure the smooth operation of the new version, including:

1. Tabletop exercises: Simulated incidents to test the effectiveness of the playbook in a controlled environment.
2. Live drills: Full-scale incident response simulations involving all relevant teams and systems.
3. Post-exercise reviews: Analysis of each exercise to identify areas for improvement and implement necessary changes.

## Training and Awareness

All staff members involved in the incident response process will be trained on the updated playbooks. This includes:

1. Initial training sessions to familiarize team members with the new features and procedures.
2. Ongoing refresher courses to maintain proficiency and adapt to any changes.
3. Regular awareness campaigns to keep all employees informed about the importance of security incident response and their role in it.
