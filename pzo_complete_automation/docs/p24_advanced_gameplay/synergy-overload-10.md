Synergy Overload 10
======================

Synergy Overload 10 is an advanced feature in our game that allows players to unlock unique combinations of abilities for their characters. This guide will explain how it works, the benefits it offers, and how you can take advantage of it.

**Prerequisites**
------------------

To use Synergy Overload 10, you need to have completed certain quests and obtained specific items in the game. Here's a quick rundown:

- Reach level 60 and complete the main storyline up to Act V.
- Obtain 10 Synergy Cores from defeating bosses and completing special events.
- Collect 5 Legendary Artifacts, which can be found in random encounters or purchased from other players.

**How it Works**
------------------

Once you have the required items, visit the Synergy Master in the main city. They will help you activate Synergy Overload 10 for one of your characters. The process will consume all 10 Synergy Cores and 5 Legendary Artifacts, so choose wisely!

After activation, your character's abilities will be rearranged into a new, powerful combination designed to take advantage of the synergies between them. The exact changes vary depending on the character and artifacts used, but you can expect improved damage output, survivability, or utility.

**Benefits**
-------------

Activating Synergy Overload 10 provides numerous benefits:

- Increased damage output: Characters with activated Synergy Overload 10 deal more damage than their non-Overloaded counterparts. This makes them ideal for tackling difficult bosses and high-level content.
- Improved survivability: Some synergies result in characters becoming tougher to kill, making them better suited for challenging encounters.
- Enhanced utility: Certain combinations of abilities can provide unique benefits, such as crowd control, area of effect damage, or healing capabilities.

**Taking Advantage of Synergy Overload 10**
--------------------------------------------

To make the most out of Synergy Overload 10, consider the following tips:

- Choose a character with synergies that complement their playstyle and abilities. For example, if you have a ranged damage dealer, opt for synergies that boost their damage output or provide crowd control.
- Experiment with different artifacts to find the best combination for your chosen character. Keep in mind that each artifact provides unique bonuses, so tailor your selection to your playstyle and needs.
- Be prepared to invest time and resources into obtaining Synergy Cores and Legendary Artifacts. This may require farming certain areas or participating in events.
- Use Synergy Overload 10 wisely. Since it consumes valuable items, save it for situations where the boost will make a significant difference, such as boss fights or challenging dungeons.
