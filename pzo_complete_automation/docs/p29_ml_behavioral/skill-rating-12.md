# ML Behavioral + Personalization: Skill Rating 12

This document provides an overview of the ML Behavioral and Personalization feature, focusing on Skill Rating 12.

## Overview

The ML Behavioral and Personalization feature is designed to enhance user engagement and experience by tailoring content based on users' behavior and preferences. Skill Rating 12 is a significant level within this feature that leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user interactions and adjust content accordingly.

## Key Features

1. **Behavior Analysis**: The system tracks user interactions such as clicks, scrolls, and time spent on specific content. This data is used to understand user preferences and behavior patterns.

2. **Personalized Content Delivery**: Based on the analyzed data, the system delivers personalized content to each user, ensuring a more engaging and relevant experience.

3. **Adaptive Learning**: The system learns from user interactions over time, continually improving its ability to predict user preferences and deliver personalized content.

4. **Skill Rating System**: Skill Rating 12 is a level within the feature that focuses on advanced machine learning techniques to analyze complex behavior patterns and deliver highly tailored content.

## Implementation Details

The ML Behavioral and Personalization feature uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:

1. **Supervised Learning Algorithms**: These are trained on labeled data, where the correct output is provided for each input. Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines.

2. **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**: These are used when labeled data is not available. Clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, are examples of unsupervised learning methods.

## Usage

To use the ML Behavioral and Personalization feature with Skill Rating 12, integrate it into your application's backend. The feature provides APIs for sending user interaction data and retrieving personalized content.
