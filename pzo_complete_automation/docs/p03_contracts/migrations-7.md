Title: Migrations 7: Contracts First Approach

## Introduction

In this documentation, we outline the key changes and updates related to contracts in the 7th round of migrations. This migration focuses on refining existing contracts and introducing new ones to enhance functionality and improve system efficiency.

## Highlights

1. **Upgraded ERC-20 Token Contract**
- The upgraded ERC-20 token contract improves token transfer speed and reduces gas fees. It also incorporates additional safety measures for more secure transactions.

2. **New ERC-721 NFT Contract**
- A new ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) contract has been implemented, offering a platform for creating unique digital assets such as collectibles and in-game items.

3. **Improved Marketplace Smart Contracts**
- The marketplace smart contracts have been optimized to improve the speed of transactions, enhance user experience, and reduce gas costs.

4. **Lending Protocol Enhancements**
- Modifications to the lending protocol ensure improved liquidity, more efficient interest rate calculations, and reduced smart contract vulnerabilities.

5. **Oracle Integration**
- Oracle integration brings real-world data into our smart contracts, enabling more accurate pricing of assets and facilitating complex financial derivatives.

6. **Security Audit**
- The system underwent a thorough security audit to identify potential vulnerabilities and rectify them before deployment.

## Migration Process

1. Upgrade the ERC-20 token contract using the provided migration script.
2. Implement the new ERC-721 NFT contract, creating the necessary collections as required.
3. Optimize marketplace smart contracts by updating your local copy and deploying to the blockchain.
4. Make modifications to the lending protocol in your existing smart contracts.
5. Integrate the Oracle for access to real-world data.
6. Conduct a security audit on all updated or newly created contracts before deployment.

## Conclusion

The 7th round of migrations introduces several improvements and additions to our contract ecosystem, laying the groundwork for further development and expanding the capabilities of our platform. Users can look forward to faster transactions, enhanced security, and new features such as NFTs and a more efficient lending protocol.
