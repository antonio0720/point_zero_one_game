Title: Migrations-3: Contracts First Approach

## Introduction

This document outlines the third phase of our project, focusing on the Contracts First approach.

## Objectives

1. Define and implement smart contracts for various functionalities.
2. Test and debug the smart contracts to ensure they meet their intended purposes.
3. Deploy the verified smart contracts onto the Ethereum blockchain.
4. Integrate the deployed contracts with the front-end applications.

## Smart Contracts Overview

1. **Token Contract**: This contract will manage the native token of our decentralized application, including minting, burning, and transferring tokens.

2. **Voting Contract**: This contract will handle voting processes within our decentralized application, such as proposing, voting, and tallying results.

3. **Governance Contract**: This contract will manage the governance aspect of our decentralized application, allowing community members to propose and vote on changes to the platform's rules and configurations.

## Testing and Debugging

Thorough testing and debugging are essential to ensure that our smart contracts function as intended. We will use a combination of manual testing, unit testing, and security audits to verify the contracts before deploying them.

## Deployment

Upon successful verification, the smart contracts will be deployed onto the Ethereum blockchain using an appropriate deployment tool like Truffle or Hardhat.

## Integration with Front-end Applications

Once the smart contracts are deployed and verified, we will integrate them with our front-end applications to allow users to interact with the decentralized application seamlessly.

## Conclusion

The third phase of our project focuses on implementing and deploying smart contracts using a Contracts First approach. Successful completion of this phase will bring us one step closer to having a fully functional decentralized application.
