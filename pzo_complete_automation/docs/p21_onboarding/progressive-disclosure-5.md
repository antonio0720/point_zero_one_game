# Progressive Disclosure - Step 5

Welcome to the fifth step of our onboarding and training program focusing on Progressive Disclosure!

## What is Progressive Disclosure?

Progressive disclosure is a design technique that hides less frequently used or complex features, revealing them only when needed. It simplifies user interfaces by providing just enough information at the right time, enhancing user experience and reducing cognitive load.

## Key Concepts

1. **Simplicity**: Showing only essential features to the user initially and unveiling more complex ones as needed.
2. **Contextual Aid**: Providing help or instructions based on the user's current context, rather than overwhelming them with information they may not need.
3. **User-Centered Design**: Focusing on understanding users' needs, tasks, and preferences to create an effective progressive disclosure strategy.
4. **Interaction Design**: Designing interactive elements that reveal additional functionality in response to user actions or changes in context.

## Best Practices

1. **Leverage visual cues**: Use icons, labels, or hover states to indicate hidden features and encourage exploration.
2. **Provide clear navigation**: Offer intuitive methods for users to navigate between visible and hidden content.
3. **Offer user control**: Give users the option to customize what information is displayed, allowing them to tailor their experience to their needs.
4. **Limit distractions**: Minimize clutter by hiding unnecessary details until they are required, ensuring that users remain focused on the task at hand.
5. **Consistent design**: Maintain a consistent look and feel across all progressive disclosure elements to promote user familiarity and reduce learning curve.

By following these best practices, you can create an effective Progressive Disclosure strategy that streamlines your user interfaces and enhances the overall user experience. Happy designing!
