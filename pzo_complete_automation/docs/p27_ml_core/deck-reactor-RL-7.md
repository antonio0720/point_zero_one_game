Deck-Reactor RL-7
===================

Overview
--------

Deck-Reactor RL-7 is a machine learning model developed as part of the ML Core series. This specific model leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) for decision making and control tasks, where it learns by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal. The Deck-Reactor RL-7 model has been fine-tuned to offer optimal performance in various applications such as game playing, robotics, and resource management systems.

Architecture
-------------

The core architecture of the Deck-Reactor RL-7 model consists of:

1. State Representation: The environment's current state is represented by a high-dimensional vector that captures essential features.
2. Q-function Approximator: A neural network approximates the Q-value function, which estimates the expected reward of taking a specific action in a given state.
3. Exploration Strategy: An exploration strategy determines how the agent interacts with the environment to learn new states and optimize its behavior.
4. Training Algorithm: The model uses the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for efficient training and convergence.
5. Model Deployment: Once trained, the Deck-Reactor RL-7 model can be deployed in various applications to control agents, make decisions, or optimize resources based on learned policies.

Training Deck-Reactor RL-7
--------------------------
