# 8. Rewards and Retention Loops

## Overview

This document outlines the design for casual rewards, verified rewards, and retention loops in Point Zero One Digital's 12-minute financial roguelike game. The focus is on creating engaging, non-powerful incentives to encourage player participation and retention.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Casual Rewards**: Streak cosmetics, participation titles, and weekly resets should be accessible to all players without any power implications.
2. **Verified Rewards**: Season badges, verified-only cosmetics, and invite eligibility are exclusive rewards for verified users, enhancing the sense of community and exclusivity.
3. **Retention Loops**: Implement mechanisms that encourage players to return regularly, such as progression systems, daily challenges, and limited-time events.

## Implementation Spec

### Casual Rewards

#### Streak Cosmetics

Players earn cosmetic rewards for maintaining a certain number of consecutive gameplay days. The reward tiers could be:

- 3 days: Uncommon cosmetic item
- 7 days: Rare cosmetic item
- 14 days: Epic cosmetic item
- 28 days: Legendary cosmetic item

#### Participation Titles

Players receive titles based on their participation in games. Examples include "Rookie," "Veteran," and "Champion." Titles could be updated weekly to reflect the player's current streak.

#### Weekly Resets

At the start of each week, players receive a reset of their daily challenges and cosmetic streaks. This encourages players to return regularly to maintain their progress.

### Verified Rewards

#### Season Badges

Players who verify their account during a specific season earn exclusive badges that display on their profile. These badges could be tied to specific achievements, such as reaching a certain level or completing a limited-time event.

#### Verified-Only Cosmetics

Verified users have access to cosmetic items that are not available to non-verified players. This creates an incentive for players to verify their accounts and fosters a sense of community among verified users.

#### Invite Eligibility

Verified users can invite friends to join the game, with both parties receiving rewards upon successful invitation. This encourages players to share the game with others and grow the player base.

### Retention Loops

#### Progression Systems

Implement a progression system that rewards players for leveling up, unlocking new content, or achieving specific milestones. This provides players with long-term goals and encourages them to continue playing.

#### Daily Challenges

Offer daily challenges that reward players with cosmetic items, in-game currency, or other benefits upon completion. These challenges should be designed to encourage players to engage with different aspects of the game each day.

#### Limited-Time Events

Host limited-time events that offer exclusive rewards for participation. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages players to return regularly to participate in these events.

## Edge Cases

1. **Account Verification**: Ensure a smooth account verification process to minimize frustration for players. Provide clear instructions and support resources to help players verify their accounts successfully.
2. **Cosmetic Items**: Implement a system for tracking cosmetic items to prevent duplicates and ensure that rewards are delivered correctly.
3. **Retention Loops**: Monitor player engagement data to identify which retention loops are most effective and adjust the system as needed to maximize player retention.
