# Competitive Night Guide for Pzo_Host_Os_Kit_V1

## Overview

This guide outlines the rules and procedures for the Competitive Night format in Point Zero One Digital's game. The format includes ladder stakes, side-bet mechanics, leaderboard display, tension escalation script, winner ceremony clip format, and 'revenge run' booking ritual.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Ladder Stakes**: Players compete in a single-elimination tournament. The loser of each round is eliminated, and the winner advances to the next round.

2. **Side-Bet Mechanics**: Additional wagers can be made between players outside of the main competition. These bets should be transparent and agreed upon by all parties involved.

3. **Leaderboard Display**: A real-time leaderboard will be displayed during the event, showing the current standings of all participants.

4. **Tension Escalation Script**: A script will be used to increase tension throughout the competition, such as time limits, power-ups, or obstacles.

5. **Winner Ceremony Clip Format**: The winner ceremony clip should include the winning player's in-game character, their score, and any relevant side-bet winnings.

6. **'Revenge Run' Booking Ritual**: After a loss, players can book a 'revenge run' match against their previous opponent to settle the score.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Ladder Stakes**: Use a bracket system to manage the tournament structure. Ensure that each round is timed and automatically advances when all matches are completed.

2. **Side-Bet Mechanics**: Implement a separate interface for side-bets, allowing players to easily view and manage their wagers.

3. **Leaderboard Display**: Develop a real-time leaderboard that updates dynamically as matches progress and scores change.

4. **Tension Escalation Script**: Design a script that gradually increases in intensity as the competition progresses, providing an engaging experience for spectators and participants alike.

5. **Winner Ceremony Clip Format**: Create a template for winner ceremony clips that includes the winning player's character, score, and side-bet winnings (if applicable).

6. **'Revenge Run' Booking Ritual**: Implement a system for players to challenge each other to 'revenge run' matches, with the option to accept or decline the challenge.

## Edge Cases

1. **Tie Matches**: In case of a tie, implement a best-of-three or best-of-five series to determine the winner.

2. **Player Absence**: If a player is unable to participate in a scheduled match, consider allowing them to forfeit or reschedule the match at a later time.

3. **Technical Issues**: In case of technical difficulties during a match, provide a mechanism for players and spectators to report the issue and initiate a resolution process.

4. **Side-Bet Disputes**: Implement a dispute resolution system for side-bets, ensuring that all parties involved are satisfied with the outcome.
