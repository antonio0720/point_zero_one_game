# Point Zero One Digital - Game Night Script v1.0

## Overview

This document outlines the structure and rules for a 90-minute and 2-hour game night script for PZO's financial roguelike game, adhering to the 5-block structure: Warm Start/Run1/Debrief1/Run2/Closing. The script includes verbatim host lines, consent script, pace rules, and a community night variant.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Strict TypeScript usage with no 'any' type. All code is strict-mode.
2. Deterministic effects in the game.
3. Adherence to the 5-block structure for each game night.
4. Clear and concise language throughout the script.
