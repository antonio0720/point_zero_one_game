# Point Zero One Digital - Host XP Progression (v1)

This document outlines the Host XP ladder and associated badge criteria, rewards, and rules for the game "Point Zero One Digital".

## Overview

The Host XP ladder consists of four tiers: Rookie, Veteran, Pro, and Sovereign. Progression through these tiers is based on achieving specific badges, which offer cosmetic and status rewards. Reaching the Sovereign tier unlocks Community Nights hosting privileges.

## Non-negotiables

1. Strict TypeScript adherence: Never use 'any'. All code is strict-mode.
2. Deterministic effects: All game mechanics are designed to produce consistent results.
3. Production-grade, deployment-ready infrastructure.

## Implementation Spec

### Badge Criteria

1. **Clean Night**: Achieve 7 consecutive days of hosting without any player disconnections or crashes.
2. **Clip Printer**: Successfully print 50 unique clips (game records) during hosted games.
3. **Recruiter**: Recruit and retain 5 new hosts within a 30-day period.
4. **Season Host**: Actively host games during three consecutive seasons.

### Rewards

Upon achieving each badge, the host will receive cosmetic rewards (e.g., custom avatar, unique emotes) and status indicators (e.g., badge icons next to their username).

### Community Nights Hosting

Reaching the Sovereign tier unlocks the ability to host Community Nights, special events open to all players. These events offer exclusive rewards and opportunities for interaction within the Point Zero One Digital community.

## Edge Cases

1. If a player disconnects or experiences a crash during a Clean Night streak, the streak resets.
2. Clip Printer badge progress is reset at the start of each season.
3. Recruiter badge progress is reset every 30 days.
4. Season Host badge progress is reset at the start of each new season.
