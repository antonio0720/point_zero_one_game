# 08_RETENTION_ENGINE.md - Point Zero One Digital

## Overview

This document outlines the expansion and reproduction of retention levers, Host XP ladder, Next Night Contract, social montage object, and community seasons spec for PZOD's financial roguelike game.

## Non-negotiables

1. All changes must adhere to strict TypeScript and strict-mode coding standards.
2. Avoid using 'any' in TypeScript.
3. Maintain deterministic effects across all features.
4. Ensure precision, execution-grade language, and anti-bureaucratic style.

## Implementation Spec

### Retention Levers

#### Belonging
- Implement a dynamic player-to-player interaction system that encourages camaraderie and shared goals.
- Reward players for collaborative achievements with exclusive in-game items or bonuses.

#### Identity
- Allow players to customize their avatars, names, and other visual elements to express individuality.
- Implement a reputation system that rewards players for positive contributions to the community.

#### Narrative
- Develop branching storylines based on player choices and actions throughout the game.
- Introduce recurring characters with unique personalities and backstories to engage players emotionally.

#### Proof
- Implement a leaderboard system that ranks players based on their performance and progress.
- Offer in-game achievements for milestones reached, encouraging players to strive for improvement.

#### Momentum
- Design dynamic challenges that adapt to the player's skill level, keeping gameplay fresh and engaging.
- Implement a system that rewards players for consecutive daily logins or consistent activity.

### Host XP Ladder
- Create a tiered progression system for players based on their experience points (XP).
- Offer exclusive in-game items, bonuses, or access to premium content as players advance through the ladder.

### Next Night Contract
- Introduce a recurring event that offers players a unique challenge and rewards upon completion.
- Ensure the Next Night Contract is designed to be challenging but achievable for players of all skill levels.

### Social Montage Object
- Implement a feature that allows players to create and share montages of their in-game achievements.
- Offer rewards for popular or creative montages, encouraging player engagement and community growth.

### Community Seasons
- Establish an 8-week arc structure for seasonal events, offering exclusive content, challenges, and rewards.
- Ensure each season has a unique theme that ties into the game's narrative and encourages player participation.

## Edge Cases

- Consider implementing a system to handle players who attempt to exploit or manipulate the retention levers for unfair advantages.
- Design a mechanism to address players who engage in toxic behavior, potentially including temporary bans or account suspensions.
