# 07_RELEASE_WORKFLOW

## Overview

This document outlines the release workflow for Point Zero One Digital's content production, focusing on clip selection rules, editing guidelines, posting cadence, invite loop lines, file naming convention, and a new batch release system for community nights.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Clip Selection**: Only high-quality, engaging, and relevant clips are selected for release. Each clip should be no more than 15 minutes long to maintain viewer interest.
2. **Editing Rules**: Edits must be concise and purposeful, ensuring the clip's message is clear and impactful. Over-editing or unnecessary additions are discouraged.
3. **Posting Cadence**: Content will be posted daily (D1–D14) to maintain a consistent release schedule.
4. **Invite Loop Lines**: Each video must include invitations for viewers to engage, such as asking questions, sharing the content, or subscribing for more updates.
5. **File Naming Convention**: All files should follow a standard naming convention that includes the project name, clip number, and date of release.
6. **Batch Release (Community Nights)**: A batch release system will be implemented for community nights, allowing for the release of 10+ clips per week to cater to increased demand.

## Implementation Spec

### Clip Selection Rules

- Clips should be engaging and informative, focusing on technical aspects of Point Zero One Digital's projects.
- Each clip should have a clear purpose and message that resonates with the target audience.
- Clips should be no longer than 15 minutes to ensure viewer engagement and prevent information overload.

### Editing Guidelines

- Edits must be concise and purposeful, ensuring the clip's message is clear and impactful.
- Over-editing or unnecessary additions are discouraged as they may dilute the original content.
- Use TypeScript strict mode and avoid using 'any'.
- All effects should be deterministic to maintain consistency across all clips.

### Posting Cadence

- Content will be posted daily (D1–D14) to maintain a consistent release schedule.
- Weekends may see reduced posting frequency, with priority given to high-impact or time-sensitive content.

### Invite Loop Lines

- Each video must include invitations for viewers to engage, such as asking questions, sharing the content, or subscribing for more updates.
- These invitations should be subtle and integrated seamlessly into the video's narrative.

### File Naming Convention

- All files should follow a standard naming convention that includes the project name, clip number, and date of release (e.g., `pzo_project_001_2023-04-01`).

### Batch Release (Community Nights)

- A batch release system will be implemented for community nights, allowing for the release of 10+ clips per week to cater to increased demand.
- These releases should still adhere to all other workflow rules and guidelines.

## Edge Cases

- In cases where a clip exceeds the 15-minute limit due to its complexity or importance, it may be split into multiple parts for release.
- If a clip's content is time-sensitive, it may be prioritized over other content for immediate release, even if this means deviating from the regular posting cadence.
