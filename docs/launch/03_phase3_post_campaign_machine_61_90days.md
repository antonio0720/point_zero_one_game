# Phase 3 (Days 61–90) Post-Campaign Activities for PZO Digital Game Launch

This phase spans from Day 61 to Day 90, following the end of the campaign. The primary focus during this period is on expanding distribution channels and activating key initiatives.

## Non-negotiables

1. **DTC Store Opening**: Simultaneously with the campaign's conclusion, our Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) store must be launched to ensure immediate sales opportunities.
2. **Amazon + Retail Pitch Deck**: Prepare a comprehensive pitch deck for Amazon and retail partnerships, detailing game features, market potential, and revenue projections.
3. **Bulk Partnership Outreach**: Initiate targeted outreach efforts towards employers, churches, schools, and other relevant organizations to establish bulk purchase agreements.
4. **Play-to-Prosper Pledge Activation**: Launch the Play-to-Prosper Pledge, encouraging players to support the game's development through donations or sponsorships.

## Implementation Spec

1. **DTC Store Preparation**: Ensure that the store is fully stocked with game copies and ready for immediate sales upon campaign conclusion.
2. **Pitch Deck Creation**: Collaborate with marketing and finance teams to create a compelling pitch deck, focusing on data-driven insights and clear revenue projections.
3. **Outreach Strategy Development**: Develop an outreach strategy that targets key organizations, including email templates, social media messaging, and potential partnership incentives.
4. **Play-to-Prosper Pledge Launch**: Design a user-friendly interface for the Play-to-Prosper Pledge, making it easy for players to contribute to the game's development.

## Edge Cases
