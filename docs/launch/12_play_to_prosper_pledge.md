# Play-to-Prosper Pledge: Empowering Communities through Gaming

Point Zero One Digital's Play-to-Prosper Pledge is a unique donation mechanism designed to support education and community engagement. This initiative offers three distinct options for participation:

1. **Classroom Copy**: A boxed edition of the game, intended for educational purposes in schools or homeschooling environments.
2. **Community Game Night Kit**: A set of games for hosting engaging events within local communities.
3. **Scholarship into Coaching Cohort**: An opportunity for individuals to join our coaching cohort, receiving mentorship and guidance from industry experts.

## Non-Negotiables

1. All donations must be made through the designated channels provided by Point Zero One Digital.
2. Donors will receive a confirmation of their pledge, including details about the benefits associated with each level of contribution.
3. The community dashboard will provide real-time tracking of all pledges and donations.
4. All effects in the game are deterministic, ensuring fairness and transparency.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Pledge Tracking**: A system for recording and managing pledges, including donor information, pledge level, and associated benefits.
2. **Community Dashboard**: An online platform where donors can view real-time updates on the progress of the campaign, including total funds raised and number of pledges received.
3. **Press Release Template**: A standardized template for announcing the Play-to-Prosper Pledge to the media, detailing the initiative's goals, benefits, and impact.
4. **501c3 Partnership Options**: Collaboration with recognized non-profit organizations to facilitate tax-deductible donations and expand the reach of the campaign.

## Edge Cases

1. In the event of a dispute or error in pledge tracking, Point Zero One Digital will provide a transparent resolution process for donors and administrators.
2. If a scholarship recipient is unable to complete the coaching cohort for any reason, an alternative opportunity will be provided, such as extended access to course materials or a partial refund of the donation.
