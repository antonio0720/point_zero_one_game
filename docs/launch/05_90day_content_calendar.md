# 90-Day Content Calendar for Point Zero One Digital

This content calendar outlines a 90-day plan with 90 clip concepts, each mapped to specific deck types (FUBAR/OPPORTUNITY/MISSED_OPPORTUNITY/PRIVILEGED/SO), posting cadence per platform, and designated weekly challenge injection dates. Influencer activation windows are also included.

## Non-Negotiables

1. All content must adhere to Point Zero One Digital's strict-mode TypeScript policy and deterministic effects.
2. The use of 'any' in TypeScript is strictly prohibited.
3. Content must be anti-bureaucratic, using precise, execution-grade language.
4. Each clip concept should be unique and engaging, providing value to our audience.
5. Posting cadence and platform selection should be optimized for maximum reach and engagement.
6. Weekly challenges and influencer activations should align with current events and game updates.

### Influencer Activation Windows

Influencers will be activated on a rotating basis, with each having a dedicated week for content creation and promotion. This will ensure maximum reach and engagement across various platforms.

## Edge Cases

1. If a clip concept fails to meet quality standards, it may be rescheduled or replaced with an alternative concept.
2. In the event of game updates or significant events, the content calendar may need to be adjusted to reflect these changes.
3. Influencer activation windows may occasionally overlap if necessary to maximize reach and engagement.
