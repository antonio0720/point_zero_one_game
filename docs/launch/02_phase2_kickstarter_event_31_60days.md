# Phase 2 (Days 31–60): Kickstarter Campaign Event

## Overview

During this phase, we will launch our Kickstarter campaign as an event, not a listing. The campaign will feature tiered pledge options at $49, $99, $149, $299, and $999.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Deterministic Code**: All effects in the Kickstarter campaign will be deterministic to ensure fairness and transparency.
2. **Strict TypeScript**: All code related to the Kickstarter campaign will adhere to strict TypeScript mode, with 'any' not used.
3. **Daily Live Streams**: We will conduct daily live streams featuring real reactions to foster community engagement.
4. **Stretch Goals**: Stretch goals will be mapped to Season 1 content to incentivize higher pledges and unlock additional features.
5. **Backer Communication Cadence**: A consistent communication cadence with backers will be maintained throughout the campaign.

## Implementation Spec

### Tier Design

- $49 tier: Basic rewards (digital copy of the game, name in credits, etc.)
- $99 tier: Additional rewards (beta access, exclusive digital art, etc.)
- $149 tier: Premium rewards (physical merchandise, early access to Season 1 content, etc.)
- $299 tier: Exclusive rewards (personalized in-game items, one-on-one gameplay sessions with developers, etc.)
- $999 tier: Elite rewards (limited edition physical collectibles, personalized digital art, etc.)

### Daily Live Streams

- Scheduled at a consistent time each day to accommodate various time zones.
- Will include updates on the campaign's progress, Q&A sessions, and sneak peeks of gameplay or Season 1 content.

### Stretch Goals

- Mapped to specific milestones in our funding goal.
- Each stretch goal will unlock additional features or content within Season 1.

### Backer Communication Cadence

- Regular updates on the campaign's progress, including pledge count and stretch goal achievements.
- Personalized emails for higher-tier backers to thank them for their support and provide exclusive updates.
- Responsive customer service for any questions or concerns from backers.

## Edge Cases

- If a stretch goal is reached before the end of the campaign, the rewards will be unlocked immediately upon reaching the goal.
- In case of technical issues during live streams, backup plans will be in place to ensure continuity and minimal disruption.
