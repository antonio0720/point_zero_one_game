# Point Zero One Digital Influencer Activation Playbook

## Overview

This playbook outlines the strategy for activating influencers of various tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Micro) in our game, Sovereign. The approach includes gifting and paid collaborations, brief templates, approved talking points, FTC disclosure language, and clip rights agreements.

## Non-Negotiables

1. All code is strict-mode TypeScript, adhering to Point Zero One Digital's coding standards.
2. Deterministic effects in all game elements.
3. Strict compliance with FTC guidelines for influencer collaborations.
4. Clip rights agreements must be signed before any content is shared.

## Implementation Spec

### Tier 1 (1M+ followers)

- Paid collaborations are preferred due to the reach and impact.
- Brief templates should focus on game features, unique selling points, and call-to-actions.
- Approved talking points must emphasize the production-grade, deployment-ready nature of Sovereign.
- FTC disclosure language should be clearly visible in all content.
- Clip rights agreements are mandatory for all collaborations.

### Tier 2 (100k-1M followers)

- A mix of gifting and paid collaborations is recommended based on the influencer's engagement rate.
- Brief templates should highlight game mechanics, gameplay elements, and key features.
- Approved talking points must focus on the game's innovative design and deterministic effects.
- FTC disclosure language should be prominently displayed in all content.
- Clip rights agreements are mandatory for all collaborations.

### Micro (10k-100k followers)

- Gifting is the primary approach due to budget constraints.

## Edge Cases
