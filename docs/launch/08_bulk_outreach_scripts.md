## Edge Cases

In cases where the intended recipient is not an HR director, pastor, or administrator, adjust the script accordingly while maintaining the same structure and key points. For example, when reaching out to a school counselor, focus on the game's role in supporting students' emotional well-being and mental health alongside financial literacy.
