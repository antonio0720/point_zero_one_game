# Phase 1 (Days 1–30): Viral Proof Campaign

## Overview

This phase focuses on locking down watchable mechanics, creating 100 short clips in a hook-chaos-principle format, designing a waitlist landing page, and seeding 50 table leaders with the host kit and script.

## Non-Negotiables

- Strict adherence to TypeScript's strict mode, avoiding usage of 'any'.
- Deterministic effects in all code.
- Precise, execution-grade language in all documentation.
- Zero fluff, anti-bureaucratic approach.

## Implementation Spec

### Watchable Mechanics

- Lock down 3–5 OH NO moments per run.
- Incorporate 2 genius moments per run.
- Introduce 1 brutal lesson per run.

### Clip Production

- Create 100 short clips (60s each) in the hook-chaos-principle format.
- Ensure each clip is engaging, chaotic, and follows the principle of hooks.

### Waitlist Landing Page

- Design an enticing waitlist landing page to attract potential players.
- Include necessary information about the game and its features.
- Implement a sign-up form for interested players.

### Table Leader Seeding

- Compile a list of 50 influential table leaders in the gaming community.
- Prepare a host kit and script for each leader.
- Distribute the kits and scripts to these leaders, encouraging them to share their experiences with the game.

## Edge Cases

- In case of unavailability or non-response from any table leader, identify an alternative influential figure to seed with the host kit and script.
