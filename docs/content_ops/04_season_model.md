# Season Model

Point Zero One Digital's season model is a core component of our 12-minute financial roguelike game. The model outlines the progression of seasons, each with unique card sets, story arcs, league ladders, and prizes, providing a structured content calendar skeleton.

## Overview

The season model consists of five distinct phases:

1. Season 1 - Stability
2. Season 2 - Leverage
3. Season 3 - Crash
4. Season 4 - Recovery
5. Season 5 - Empire

Each season introduces new challenges, opportunities, and narrative elements to engage players and maintain interest throughout the game's lifecycle.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Per-season card sets**: Each season will feature a unique set of cards, ensuring that players have fresh content to explore and master.
2. **Story arcs**: A narrative progression will be woven throughout the seasons, providing context and motivation for gameplay decisions.
3. **League ladders**: Players will compete in league ladders within each season, allowing them to measure their progress against others and earn rewards.
4. **Prizes**: Seasonal prizes will incentivize players to participate actively and strive for improvement.
5. **Content calendar skeleton**: The season model provides a structured framework for content releases, ensuring that new content is consistently delivered to players.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Season 1 - Stability**: Focus on teaching players the game's mechanics and introducing them to basic strategies. Card sets will emphasize foundational concepts, such as income generation and risk management.
2. **Season 2 - Leverage**: Introduce more advanced strategies and card sets that allow players to take on greater risks for potentially higher rewards. The narrative will explore themes of ambition and growth.
3. **Season 3 - Crash**: Increase the difficulty level by introducing unexpected events, such as market crashes or regulatory changes, that challenge players' strategies. Card sets will reflect these new challenges, with a focus on resilience and adaptability.
4. **Season 4 - Recovery**: Players will need to navigate a recovering market while dealing with the aftermath of the crash. Card sets will emphasize rebuilding and recovery strategies, as well as lessons learned from previous seasons.
5. **Season 5 - Empire**: In this final season, players will have the opportunity to build their financial empires and compete for top positions on league ladders. The narrative will focus on themes of power, success, and legacy.

## Edge Cases

1. **Player progression**: Players who perform exceptionally well in one season may be granted early access or additional benefits in the following season to maintain engagement and challenge them further.
2. **Season extension**: In the event that a season is not meeting player engagement expectations, it may be extended to provide more time for players to master its challenges and enjoy its content.
3. **Season skipping**: Players who have already mastered a season's content may be given the option to skip it and move on to the next one, ensuring that they remain engaged and challenged.
