# Promise and Operating Posture

## Overview

In Point Zero One Digital, we commit to a player-facing promise that is fair, improves over time, and respects the player's time. Our LiveOps posture mirrors an exchange, ensuring measured, auditable, and fast micro-patches for seamless gameplay.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Fairness**: All updates and changes are designed to maintain a balanced and fair gaming environment for all players.
2. **Improvement**: We continuously strive to enhance the player experience through regular updates and optimizations.
3. **Respecting Time**: We understand that players' time is valuable, so we aim to minimize disruptions and ensure quick, efficient updates.
4. **Measured**: All changes are thoroughly tested and measured for their impact on gameplay before implementation.
5. **Auditable**: All updates and changes are logged and can be audited by players or moderators upon request.
6. **Fast Micro-Patches**: We prioritize quick, targeted fixes to address any issues that may arise during gameplay.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Fairness**: Balance adjustments are made based on data analysis and player feedback, ensuring a fair gaming environment for all players.
2. **Improvement**: Regular updates include performance optimizations, new content, and quality-of-life improvements to enhance the overall gameplay experience.
3. **Respecting Time**: Updates are scheduled during off-peak hours to minimize disruptions and ensure smooth gameplay for all players.
4. **Measured**: All changes undergo rigorous testing in a controlled environment before being deployed to the live game.
5. **Auditable**: A comprehensive log of all updates, changes, and fixes is maintained and can be accessed by players or moderators upon request.
6. **Fast Micro-Patches**: In case of critical issues, we prioritize quick fixes to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth gaming experience for all players.

## Edge Cases

1. **Emergency Patches**: In the event of an emergency that requires immediate attention (e.g., security vulnerabilities), we may deploy patches outside of our regular update schedule. These patches will be thoroughly tested before deployment to minimize potential disruptions.
2. **Player Feedback**: If a significant number of players express concern about a change, we may reevaluate the change and consider rolling back or adjusting it as necessary.
