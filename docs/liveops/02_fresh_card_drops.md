# Fresh Card Drops Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the rules and procedures for fresh card drops in Point Zero One Digital's 12-minute financial roguelike game. The drops consist of AI-generated OPPORTUNITY cards, curated and balanced; community-submitted cards (approved); and a featured card of the week with a story.

## Non-Negotiables

1. All drops must adhere to strict TypeScript standards, using precise language and avoiding the use of 'any'. All code is written in strict mode.
2. All effects are deterministic to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
3. Balance budget enforcement is mandatory on all drops to maintain game economy stability.
4. All announcements for card drops must follow a predefined template for consistency and clarity.

## Implementation Spec

### AI-Generated OPPORTUNITY Cards

1. Cards are generated using a proprietary algorithm that ensures balance, variety, and strategic depth.
2. The algorithm takes into account the current game state, player progression, and other relevant factors to generate cards that offer unique advantages or challenges.
3. Generated cards undergo rigorous testing and balancing to ensure they do not disrupt the game's economy or create unintended exploits.

### Community-Submitted Cards

1. Players can submit card ideas through an in-game submission system or via the official forums.
2. Submissions are reviewed by a dedicated team of designers and balance testers to ensure they meet quality standards and do not disrupt the game's economy.
3. Approved cards are added to the game's card pool, with the submitter receiving in-game recognition and rewards.

### Featured Card of the Week

1. Each week, a new featured card is introduced, accompanied by a story that provides context and encourages players to use it strategically.
2. The featured card offers unique advantages or bonuses, making it an attractive choice for players.
3. Balance adjustments may be made to the featured card to ensure it remains balanced and does not disrupt the game's economy.

### Card Drop Announcement Copy Template

1. Announcements for fresh card drops follow a predefined template that includes:
   - The type of card being dropped (AI-generated, community-submitted, or featured)
   - A brief description of the card and its effects
   - Any relevant balance adjustments or gameplay considerations
   - In-game rewards for participating in the drop event
2. Announcements are made through multiple channels, including in-game notifications, social media, and the official website.

## Edge Cases

1. In rare cases where a card is found to be unbalanced or exploitable after being added to the game, it may be temporarily removed or adjusted until a permanent solution can be implemented.
2. If a community-submitted card is found to violate the game's terms of service or contain offensive content, it will not be approved for inclusion in the game.
