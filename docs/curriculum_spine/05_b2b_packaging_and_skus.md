# B2B Packaging and SKUs

## Overview

This document outlines the structure of our B2B packaging lanes for Employers, Education, and Community orgs, along with the SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) system, entitlements, and scale assumptions. The goal is to maintain a consumer-friendly vibe while catering to business needs.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Strict adherence to TypeScript**: All code will be written in strict mode with no exceptions for 'any'. This ensures type safety and reduces potential errors.
2. **Deterministic effects**: All game effects are designed to be deterministic, ensuring consistency across all deployments.
3. **Production-grade, deployment-ready infrastructure**: Our solutions are built with scalability in mind, ready for seamless integration into various business environments.

## Implementation Spec

### B2B Packaging Lanes

#### Employers

Employer packaging will focus on providing access to the game for teams and individual employees. This may include bulk discounts, team management tools, and analytics for HR departments.

#### Education

Educational packaging will cater to schools, universities, and other educational institutions. It may include features such as classroom management tools, curriculum integration, and student progress tracking.

#### Community Orgs

Community organization packaging will provide access to the game for non-profit organizations and community groups. This may include discounted pricing, group management tools, and opportunities for fundraising or awareness campaigns.

### SKU Structure

Each package will have a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) that identifies the specific features and entitlements included. The SKU structure will be designed to be easily understandable and scalable.

### Entitlements

Entitlements define what each package includes, such as access to the game, additional content, or premium features. These entitlements will be clearly defined for each SKU.

### Scale Assumptions

Our solutions are designed to scale seamlessly as our user base grows. We anticipate a wide range of usage scenarios and have built our infrastructure accordingly. Edge cases will be addressed through ongoing testing and updates.

## Edge Cases

While we strive for a consumer-friendly experience, there may be edge cases that require special consideration. These will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, with the goal of providing solutions that are both effective and user-friendly.
