# Outcome Pack v0: Cashflow Rescue

## Overview

The Cashflow Rescue Outcome Pack is a collection of 5-12 financial scenarios designed for the roguelike game, Point Zero One Digital. This pack focuses on rescuing and stabilizing cash flow in various business environments.

## Non-Negotiables

1. All scenarios must be production-grade and deployment-ready.
2. Strict TypeScript mode is mandatory, with 'any' never used.
3. All effects are deterministic to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
4. The pack should adhere to Point Zero One Digital's infrastructure architect design principles.

## Implementation Spec

### Scenario Design

Each scenario will present a unique financial challenge that requires players to make strategic decisions to rescue their cash flow. Scenarios may include:

1. Sudden drop in sales due to market competition
2. Increase in operational costs due to supply chain disruptions
3. Unforeseen expenses from regulatory compliance
4. Cash flow shortage due to delayed payments from clients
5. Unexpected loss of a key customer or supplier
6. ... (additional scenarios as needed)

### Guides and Documentation

For each scenario, include a guide that outlines the context, objectives, and potential solutions. The guide should be concise yet comprehensive, providing players with the necessary information to navigate the financial challenge effectively.

## Edge Cases

Edge cases may arise in certain scenarios where the player's decisions lead to unintended consequences or outcomes outside the intended design. In such cases, consider implementing safeguards to prevent game-breaking situations and ensure a fair and challenging experience for players.
