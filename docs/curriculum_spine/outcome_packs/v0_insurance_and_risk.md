# Outcome Pack v0: Insurance & Risk Literacy

## Overview

This outcome pack focuses on equipping players with a foundational understanding of insurance and risk management concepts within the context of financial roguelike gameplay.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Conceptual Understanding**: Players should grasp key insurance and risk terms, such as premiums, deductibles, claims, and actuarial calculations.
2. **Risk Simulation**: The game should simulate various types of risks (e.g., property damage, health emergencies) and their associated costs.
3. **Insurance Policies**: Players should be able to purchase insurance policies that provide protection against specific risks.
4. **Risk Management Strategies**: Players should learn strategies for managing risk, such as diversification, hedging, and self-insurance.
5. **Financial Impact**: The game should demonstrate the financial impact of risks and insurance on a player's overall wealth.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Insurance Market**: Create an in-game insurance market where players can purchase policies from various insurers.
2. **Risk Events**: Design random events that simulate various types of risks, each with associated costs and probabilities.
3. **Policy Details**: Provide detailed information about each insurance policy, including premiums, deductibles, coverage limits, and exclusions.
4. **Actuarial Calculations**: Implement actuarial calculations to determine the cost of insurance policies based on risk factors such as age, gender, location, and occupation.
5. **Risk Management Tools**: Offer tools for players to manage their risks, such as a portfolio manager for tracking multiple policies and a risk analysis tool for evaluating potential investments.
6. **Scenarios and Challenges**: Create scenarios and challenges that test players' understanding of insurance and risk management concepts.
