# Outcome Pack Specification for Point Zero One Digital

## Overview

An Outcome Pack is a collection of 5-12 unique scenarios designed for the financial roguelike game developed by Point Zero One Digital. Each pack includes facilitator guides, reflection prompts, and post-run recommendations to enhance the learning experience.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Scenario Count**: Each Outcome Pack must contain between 5 and 12 scenarios.
2. **Facilitator Guides**: Every scenario should have an associated facilitator guide that includes:
   - Objective: The primary goal of the scenario.
   - Watch-Fors: Key elements to observe during the gameplay.
   - Debrief: A structured discussion following the scenario to reinforce learning.
   - Next-Run Rec: Suggestions for modifications or adjustments for future runs.
3. **Reflection Prompts**: After each run, players should receive reflection prompts to encourage self-assessment and learning.
4. **TypeScript Compliance**: All code adheres to strict TypeScript mode with the avoidance of 'any' type.
5. **Deterministic Effects**: All game effects are designed to be deterministic, ensuring consistent outcomes across multiple runs.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Scenario Design**: Scenarios should be crafted to simulate various financial situations and challenges that players may encounter in real-world scenarios.
2. **Facilitator Guides**: Facilitators should provide clear, concise, and actionable guidance for each scenario to ensure a productive learning experience.
3. **Reflection Prompts**: Reflection prompts should be thoughtfully crafted to encourage players to reflect on their strategies, decisions, and outcomes during the gameplay.
4. **Code Quality**: All code should adhere to production-grade standards, ensuring it is deployment-ready and maintainable.
5. **Testing**: Thorough testing should be conducted to ensure that each scenario functions as intended and provides a valuable learning experience for players.

## Edge Cases

1. **Scenario Complexity**: In some cases, scenarios may require additional complexity to accurately simulate real-world financial situations. However, this complexity should not compromise the deterministic nature of the game effects.
2. **Player Skill Level**: Outcome Packs should cater to a range of player skill levels, with scenarios designed to challenge both novice and experienced players alike.
3. **Reflection Prompts**: Reflection prompts may need to be tailored to specific scenarios or player groups to maximize their effectiveness in promoting learning and self-assessment.
