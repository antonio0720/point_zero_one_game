# Point Zero One Digital Pilot Playbook

## Overview

This playbook outlines the 90-day pilot run for a cohort of Sovereign Infrastructure Architects (SIAs) in our financial roguelike game, Point Zero One Digital. The pilot will follow a weekly cadence and include facilitator scripts, measurement targets, and a renewal story.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Strict TypeScript adherence: No use of 'any'. All code is strict-mode.
2. Deterministic effects: All game mechanics are designed to produce consistent results.
3. Production-grade, deployment-ready: The game infrastructure is built for scalability and reliability.

## Implementation Spec

### Week 1 - Onboarding & Orientation

- Facilitator scripts: Introduce the game concept, rules, and objectives.
- Measurement targets: Player engagement metrics (time spent in-game, levels completed).

### Week 2 - Gameplay Introduction

- Facilitator scripts: Guide players through basic game mechanics and controls.
- Measurement targets: Player progression, resource management, and strategic decision-making.

### Week 3 - Advanced Strategies & Tactics

- Facilitator scripts: Teach advanced strategies for optimizing resources and managing risk.
- Measurement targets: Player performance, win/loss ratio, and adaptability to changing game conditions.

### Week 4 - Community Building & Collaboration

- Facilitator scripts: Encourage players to collaborate and share strategies.
- Measurement targets: Player interaction, teamwork, and community growth.

### Week 5 - Feedback & Iteration

- Facilitator scripts: Gather player feedback and make necessary adjustments to the game mechanics.

### Week 6 - Renewal Story

- Facilitator scripts: Introduce a renewal story that sets up future iterations of the game.
- Measurement targets: Player excitement for future updates, continued engagement, and potential for long-term commitment.

## Edge Cases

- Incomplete cohort: Adjust facilitator scripts and measurement targets as needed to accommodate fewer than 9 participants.
- Technical issues: Implement contingency plans for addressing unexpected technical difficulties during the pilot run.
