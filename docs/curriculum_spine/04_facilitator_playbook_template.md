# Facilitator Playbook Template & Debrief Prompt Bank

## Overview

This playbook template provides a structured approach for facilitating Point Zero One Digital game sessions, ensuring consistency and adherence to our strict-mode TypeScript development principles. The debrief prompt bank offers a set of questions to facilitate post-session discussions and improvements. This document also outlines the integration with host-night cadence for seamless scheduling.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Strict adherence to Point Zero One Digital's development principles, including:
   - Never using 'any' in TypeScript
   - All code is strict-mode
   - All effects are deterministic

2. Utilization of the provided debrief prompt bank during post-session discussions
3. Integration with host-night cadence for scheduling game sessions

## Implementation Spec

### Facilitator Playbook Template

1. **Introduction**
   - Briefly explain the purpose and rules of Point Zero One Digital
   - Highlight the importance of strict-mode TypeScript development principles

2. **Session Setup**
   - Ensure all participants have the necessary software installed
   - Confirm that all participants are using strict-mode TypeScript

3. **Gameplay Facilitation**
   - Monitor gameplay to ensure adherence to rules and development principles
   - Address any questions or issues that arise during gameplay

4. **Debrief**
   - Utilize the debrief prompt bank to guide post-session discussions
   - Encourage participants to share insights, challenges, and improvements

5. **Wrap-up**
   - Recap key takeaways from the session
   - Schedule the next game session using host-night cadence

### Debrief Prompt Bank

1. What did you find most challenging during this session?
2. Did you encounter any unexpected issues or bugs? If so, how did you address them?
3. What strategies or techniques were particularly effective during this session?
4. How could we improve the gameplay experience for future sessions?
5. Were there any opportunities to further emphasize our development principles during this session?

## Edge Cases

1. **Participant Absence**
   - If a participant is absent, ensure that their work is still reviewed and provide feedback as needed
2. **Technical Issues**
   - In the event of technical issues, troubleshoot and address them promptly to minimize disruption
3. **Debrief Time Constraints**
   - If time constraints prevent a full debrief, prioritize key takeaways and reschedule a more in-depth discussion if necessary
