# Biometric Data Licensing Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the specifications for licensing anonymized stress-response datasets within Point Zero One Digital's financial roguelike game, Sovereign. The revenue model is based on a yearly fee of $50,000 per behavioral economist, wellness platform, or insurer.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Data Protection Act (DPA) Compliance**: All data handling must adhere to the DPA requirements, ensuring privacy and security of the anonymized stress-response datasets.
2. **Consent Chain**: A transparent and secure consent chain must be established for all participants involved in data collection and usage.
3. **GDPR/CCPA Posture**: The game's infrastructure must maintain compliance with both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

## Implementation Spec

1. **Data Collection**: Anonymized stress-response data will be collected during gameplay sessions, ensuring no personally identifiable information is included.
2. **Data Storage**: The anonymized datasets will be securely stored in our production-grade, deployment-ready infrastructure, adhering to strict-mode TypeScript and deterministic effects.
3. **Licensing Agreement**: A licensing agreement will be established with each behavioral economist, wellness platform, or insurer, outlining the terms of data usage and fees.
4. **Data Access**: Access to the anonymized datasets will be granted only upon signing the licensing agreement and adherence to DPA requirements, consent chain, and GDPR/CCPA posture.
5. **Data Usage**: The licensed data can be used for research purposes related to behavioral economics, wellness, or insurance industries but must not be shared with third parties without explicit consent from Point Zero One Digital.

## Edge Cases

1. **Data Breach**: In the event of a data breach, Point Zero One Digital will promptly notify all affected parties and take necessary steps to mitigate the breach and prevent future occurrences.
2. **Data Request**: If a participant requests their data to be removed from the system, Point Zero One Digital will comply with the request within a reasonable timeframe, ensuring all associated datasets are anonymized or deleted as appropriate.
