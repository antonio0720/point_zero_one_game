# Targeted Training Recommendations

This document outlines the design and implementation of the Targeted Training Recommendations feature in Point Zero One Digital's financial roguelike game. The feature aims to provide strategic guidance for players, focusing on five key disciplines: Reserve Discipline, Burn Stabilization, Leverage Timing, Macro Shock Survival, and Missed Opportunity Control.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Strict TypeScript**: All code adheres to strict TypeScript mode for type safety and consistency.
2. **Deterministic Effects**: All effects generated by the recommendations are deterministic to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
3. **No 'Any' Type**: The use of 'any' is strictly prohibited in TypeScript to maintain type safety.
4. **Production-Grade Code**: All code is production-ready, ensuring it can handle real-world scenarios without errors or crashes.
5. **User-Friendly UX**: The Scenario Launch User Interface (UX) is designed to be intuitive and easy for players to understand and interact with.

## Implementation Spec

### Reserve Discipline

The Reserve Discipline recommendations focus on building and managing a reserve fund. This includes strategies for setting aside funds for emergencies, optimizing the reserve's growth, and minimizing its depletion during adverse market conditions.

### Burn Stabilization

Burn Stabilization recommendations help players manage their cash flow effectively. These strategies aim to ensure a steady cash burn rate, preventing sudden liquidity crises and maintaining financial stability.

### Leverage Timing

Leverage Timing recommendations provide guidance on when to use leverage (debt) in the game. This includes strategies for maximizing returns during favorable market conditions while minimizing risk during unfavorable ones.

### Macro Shock Survival

Macro Shock Survival recommendations focus on helping players navigate major economic events, such as recessions or inflation spikes. These strategies aim to help players weather these shocks and maintain financial stability.

### Missed Opportunity Control

Missed Opportunity Control recommendations help players identify and capitalize on opportunities they might have missed. This includes strategies for analyzing past performance and adjusting future strategies accordingly.

## Edge Cases

1. **Market Volatility**: The recommendations should be adaptable to varying levels of market volatility, ensuring they remain effective in both stable and turbulent markets.
2. **Player Skill Level**: The recommendations should cater to players with different skill levels, providing strategies suitable for beginners as well as experienced players.
3. **Dynamic Scenarios**: The recommendations should be able to handle dynamic scenarios, where market conditions change rapidly and require quick adjustments to the strategy.
