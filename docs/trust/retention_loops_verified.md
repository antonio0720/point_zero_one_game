# Verified Streaks, Weekly Showcases, and Missions Aligned to Verification Ritual (Cosmetics Only)

## Overview

This document outlines the rules for verified streaks, weekly showcases, and missions that are cosmetic-only and aligned with the verification ritual in Point Zero One Digital's 12-minute financial roguelike game. These features aim to encourage players to maintain a consistent engagement with the game while reinforcing the principles of deterministic effects and strict TypeScript coding.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Verified streaks, weekly showcases, and missions are exclusively cosmetic and do not affect gameplay mechanics or progression.
2. All rules adhere to Point Zero One Digital's commitment to strict TypeScript coding in strict mode.
3. The effects of these features are deterministic, ensuring fairness and reproducibility.
4. Players cannot gain any competitive advantage through cosmetic items.

## Implementation Spec

### Verified Streaks

- A verified streak is initiated when a player completes a game session without missing a day.
- The streak counter resets upon a missed day, but the cosmetic reward for the longest active streak remains.
- Cosmetic rewards for verified streaks increase in rarity and visual appeal as the streak length increases.

### Weekly Showcases

- Each week, a random player with an active verified streak will be showcased on the game's leaderboard.
- The showcased player will receive a unique cosmetic item to commemorate their achievement.
- Players can only be showcased once per week, and the same player cannot be showcased more than once in a given month.

### Missions Aligned to Verification Ritual

- Missions are tasks that players must complete within a game session to earn cosmetic rewards.
- These missions reinforce the principles of deterministic effects and strict TypeScript coding.
- Examples of missions include:
  - Completing a game session without using any non-deterministic functions.
  - Finding and fixing all bugs in the game's code within a single game session.
  - Implementing a new feature that adheres to Point Zero One Digital's coding standards.

## Edge Cases

- If a player completes multiple game sessions on the same day, only one session will count towards their verified streak. The session with the highest score will be used for this purpose.
- In the event of a tie for the longest active verified streak, both players will receive the cosmetic reward associated with that streak length.
