# After Autopsy: Cause-of-Death vs How-you-barely-lived

Welcome to the Postmortem Screen of Point Zero One Digital's 12-minute financial roguelike game. This screen provides insights into your gameplay performance, fostering a learning environment for continuous improvement.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Cause-of-Death**: Clearly display the primary reason for your character's demise to help you understand the strategic mistakes that led to this outcome.
2. **How-you-barely-lived**: Present key statistics and metrics that highlight your gameplay performance, focusing on areas where you nearly succeeded despite the ultimate failure.
3. **Actionable Insight**: Offer a single, concise piece of advice based on your performance to help guide your future strategies.
4. **'Run Again' CTA**: Encourage players to restart the game with an inviting call-to-action button labeled 'Run Again'.
5. **Non-scolding Tone**: Maintain a supportive and educational tone throughout the postmortem screen, avoiding any judgment or criticism towards the player.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Cause-of-Death**: Analyze game data to determine the primary factor that led to the character's death. Display this information in an easy-to-understand format, such as a concise sentence or bullet points.
2. **How-you-barely-lived**: Gather relevant statistics and metrics from the player's gameplay session, such as income, expenses, investments, and resource management. Present these figures in a clear and visually appealing manner to help players understand their performance.
3. **Actionable Insight**: Based on the player's data, generate a single piece of advice that could help them improve their strategies for future gameplay sessions. This insight should be specific, actionable, and relevant to the player's performance.
4. **'Run Again' CTA**: Design an inviting button labeled 'Run Again' that encourages players to restart the game and apply the lessons they've learned from the postmortem screen. Ensure the button is prominently displayed and easy to click or tap.
5. **Non-scolding Tone**: Write all text in a supportive, educational tone that emphasizes learning and improvement rather than criticism or blame. Use positive language and avoid any condescending or judgmental phrases.

## Edge Cases

1. **Multiple Factors Contributing to Death**: If multiple factors contributed to the character's death, prioritize the most significant issue in the 'Cause-of-Death' section and briefly mention other contributing factors.
2. **Exceptional Performance**: In cases where a player demonstrates exceptional performance despite ultimately losing the game, focus on the actionable insight to help them maintain their strong playstyle while addressing areas for potential improvement.
3. **New Players**: For first-time players who may not have a clear understanding of the game's mechanics, provide additional resources or tutorial links within the postmortem screen to help them improve their strategies in future sessions.
