# LiveOps Exchange Loop: Doctrine

## Overview

This document outlines the doctrine for the LiveOps Exchange Loop in Point Zero One Digital's 12-minute financial roguelike game. The purpose of this system is to reduce friction, eliminate unfair feel, stabilize the economy, and increase the one-more-run factor through telemetry analysis and regular updates.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Deterministic Effects**: All effects within the LiveOps Exchange Loop must be deterministic to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
2. **Strict TypeScript**: All code adheres to strict TypeScript mode for improved type safety and maintainability.
3. **No 'Any'**: The use of 'any' is strictly prohibited in TypeScript to maintain type consistency across the codebase.
4. **Production-Grade**: The LiveOps Exchange Loop is designed to be deployment-ready and robust, capable of handling production workloads.
5. **Daily & Weekly Updates**: Daily detection of the top 3 stop reasons and weekly shipping of 3 changes are non-negotiable for maintaining a healthy and engaging game economy.

## Implementation Spec

### Data Collection

1. Collect user interaction data within the LiveOps Exchange Loop.
2. Analyze this data to identify patterns, trends, and common stop reasons.

### Daily Updates

1. Identify the top 3 stop reasons based on the collected data.
2. Implement changes aimed at addressing these issues to reduce friction and improve user experience.

### Weekly Updates

1. Analyze user feedback, additional data, and game performance metrics to identify areas for improvement.
2. Prioritize and implement 3 changes based on the findings from the weekly analysis.

## Edge Cases

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensure that collected data is accurate, reliable, and representative of user behavior within the LiveOps Exchange Loop.
2. **User Privacy**: Respect user privacy by anonymizing all collected data and adhering to relevant data protection regulations.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor system performance and optimize as necessary to ensure smooth operation during updates and changes.
