Title: LiveOps Exchange Loop Impact Methodology

Overview:
This document outlines the methodology for conducting before/after and cohort comparisons in the context of the Point Zero One Digital's LiveOps Exchange Loop, ensuring guardrails against analytics theater.

Non-Negotiables:
1. Strict adherence to TypeScript, with 'any' explicitly avoided. All code is written in strict mode.
2. Deterministic effects across all comparisons for reproducibility and reliability.
3. Elimination of ambiguity through precise, execution-grade language and zero fluff.
4. Anti-bureaucratic approach to simplify understanding and implementation.

Implementation Spec:

1. **Baseline Establishment**: Establish a baseline for key performance indicators (KPIs) using historical data. This includes user engagement, revenue, and other relevant metrics.

2. **Intervention Implementation**: Implement the LiveOps Exchange Loop changes or updates in the production environment. Ensure all effects are deterministic to maintain consistency across comparisons.

3. **Data Collection**: Collect data post-intervention implementation for a specified duration. This data will serve as the 'after' dataset.

4. **Cohort Selection**: Select appropriate cohorts for comparison, ensuring they are representative and comparable in terms of user demographics, behavior, and other relevant factors.

5. **Comparison**: Compare the 'before' and 'after' datasets, as well as the intervention group and control group (if applicable) to identify changes in KPIs.

6. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis on the collected data to determine the significance of any observed differences.

7. **Reporting**: Document findings in a clear, concise manner, highlighting the impact of the LiveOps Exchange Loop changes and providing actionable recommendations.

Edge Cases:
1. **Data Integrity**: Ensure data integrity by validating and cleaning the collected data before analysis to account for potential errors or inconsistencies.
2. **Seasonality**: Account for seasonal fluctuations in user behavior and KPIs when conducting comparisons, as these can impact the results.
3. **Multi-factor Analysis**: Consider multiple factors that may influence KPIs, such as marketing campaigns, platform updates, or external events, to ensure accurate attribution of changes to the LiveOps Exchange Loop.
