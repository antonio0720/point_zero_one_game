# Point Zero One Digital - Integrity

Welcome to Point Zero One Digital, a leading innovator in the gaming industry. Our flagship product, a 12-minute financial roguelike game, is built on Sovereign infrastructure architecture, ensuring production-grade and deployment-ready performance.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **TypeScript**: All our code is written in TypeScript, adhering to strict mode for enhanced type checking and avoiding the use of 'any'.
2. **Deterministic Effects**: Every effect in our games is designed to be deterministic, ensuring fairness and reproducibility.
3. **Player Psychology**: We understand that trust is built on transparency. Our games are designed with a deep understanding of player psychology, fostering an environment of trust and engagement.

## Implementation Spec

Our commitment to integrity is reflected in every line of code we write. Here's how it translates into our game:

1. **Code Structure**: All our TypeScript files are written in strict mode, ensuring type safety and avoiding potential runtime errors.
2. **Game Mechanics**: Every game mechanic is designed to be deterministic, ensuring fairness and consistency across all players.
3. **Transparency**: We provide detailed documentation for each game, explaining the rules, mechanics, and any random elements used in a way that's transparent and easy to understand.

## Edge Cases

While we strive to make our games as deterministic as possible, there are some edge cases where randomness is necessary for gameplay variety. In these instances, we use techniques such as pseudorandom number generation (PRNG) to ensure predictability within the bounds of acceptable variance.
