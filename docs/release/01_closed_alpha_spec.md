# Point Zero One Digital - Closed Alpha Specification

## Overview

The Closed Alpha phase is a critical step in the development of our game, "Point Zero One Digital". This phase focuses on content harvesting, allowing players to break the game and identify lethal cards or dead metas. The insights gathered will be instrumental in refining the tutorial and improving conversion rates. Additionally, we will establish mechanics for alpha invites and implement a feedback capture pipeline.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Strict TypeScript: All code must adhere to strict mode and never use 'any'.
2. Deterministic Effects: All game effects must be deterministic to ensure consistency across all playthroughs.
3. Production-Grade Quality: All work produced during this phase should be deployment-ready.

## Implementation Specification

### Content Harvesting

Players will be given the freedom to explore and interact with the game, allowing us to gather data on potential issues, lethal cards, and dead metas. This process will help us identify areas that need improvement.

### Lethal Cards & Dead Metas Identification

Through player feedback and data analysis, we will identify combinations of cards or strategies that lead to an unfair advantage or game-breaking situations. These will be addressed and balanced accordingly.

### Tutorial Refinement

Using conversion metrics, we will refine the tutorial until the conversion rate significantly improves. This may involve adjusting pacing, providing clearer instructions, or reordering content for optimal learning.

### Alpha Invite Mechanics

We will establish a system for inviting players to participate in the Closed Alpha. This could include email invitations, social media promotions, or partnerships with gaming communities.

### Feedback Capture Pipeline

A feedback capture pipeline will be implemented to gather player opinions and suggestions. This could involve in-game surveys, forums, or direct communication channels with the development team.

## Edge Cases

1. Player Feedback: We anticipate a wide range of feedback from players, some of which may be constructive criticism, while others may be unreasonable demands. It is essential to handle all feedback professionally and use it as an opportunity for improvement.
2. Balancing Act: Identifying and balancing lethal cards or dead metas can be a complex process. We will need to ensure that changes do not inadvertently create new imbalances or unintended consequences.
