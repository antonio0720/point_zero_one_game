# Hard Gate Verification Required

## Overview

This document outlines the policy and rules for the Hard Gate Verification Required process in Point Zero One Digital's creator economy. This policy ensures that all assets and transactions meet our strict standards, promoting a secure and reliable environment for our users.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Verification**: Assets or transactions that fail verification are not allowed to go live on the platform.
2. **Required Status**: The asset or transaction must have the appropriate status (e.g., 'verified') to proceed.
3. **Verification Report ID**: Each verified asset or transaction is assigned a unique Verification Report ID for traceability and record-keeping purposes.
4. **Proof Receipts**: Proof of verification must be provided in the form of receipts or other acceptable documentation.

## Implementation Spec

1. Upon creation, assets or transactions are automatically subjected to the Hard Gate Verification process.
2. The verification process checks for compliance with our policies and standards.
3. If an asset or transaction passes verification, it is assigned a 'verified' status and a unique Verification Report ID.
4. Proof of verification (receipts) must be provided and stored securely for future reference.
5. In case of failure, the asset or transaction is denied live deployment, and the reason for rejection is communicated to the creator.
6. Sandbox fallback rules allow creators to test their assets or transactions in a controlled environment before submitting them for verification.

## Edge Cases

1. **Re-verification**: If an asset or transaction fails verification multiple times, it may be subjected to re-verification at the discretion of Point Zero One Digital's compliance team.
2. **Expedited Verification**: Certain assets or transactions may require expedited verification due to their nature or urgency. In such cases, creators can request expedited verification through our support channels.
3. **Manual Override**: In exceptional circumstances, the compliance team may choose to manually override the Hard Gate Verification process if they deem it necessary for the smooth functioning of the platform. However, this is a rare occurrence and will only be done after thorough evaluation and consultation with relevant stakeholders.
