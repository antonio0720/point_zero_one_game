# Season Placement and Revenue Share for Creators

This document outlines the rules and procedures for season placement and revenue share in Point Zero One Digital's creator economy.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Placement Pool Eligibility**: To be eligible for the placement pool, creators must meet the following criteria:
   - Maintain an active account on the platform.
   - Comply with all terms and conditions of the platform.
   - Meet minimum engagement thresholds as defined by Point Zero One Digital.

2. **Ranking Signals**: Creator rankings are determined by the following signals:
   - Engagement metrics (views, likes, comments, shares).
   - Audience growth rate.
   - Consistent content creation and updates.

3. **Verified Engagement Revenue Share**: All revenue share calculations will be based on verified engagement data. Any manipulation or fraudulent activity will result in account suspension and potential clawback of earnings.

4. **Payout Ledger**: A transparent payout ledger will be maintained for each creator, detailing their earnings, payouts, and any adjustments due to fraud or errors.

5. **Fraud Clawbacks**: In the event of fraudulent activity, Point Zero One Digital reserves the right to clawback earnings from the offending creator's account.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Placement Pool Calculation**: The placement pool will be calculated as a percentage of total platform revenue for each season. Creators who meet eligibility criteria will share in this pool based on their ranking.

2. **Ranking Determination**: Rankings will be determined at the end of each season and used to distribute the placement pool.

3. **Revenue Share Calculation**: Each creator's revenue share will be calculated as a percentage of the total placement pool, based on their ranking.

4. **Payout Processing**: Payouts will be processed automatically at the start of each new season, with details available in the creator's payout ledger.

## Edge Cases

1. **Tie Breakers**: In case of ties for a specific rank, the creator who has been active on the platform for the shortest period will be ranked lower.

2. **Inactive Creators**: Creators who do not meet the minimum engagement thresholds or violate terms and conditions may be removed from eligibility for the placement pool.

3. **Season Extension**: In the event of a season extension due to unforeseen circumstances, the placement pool calculation and payout schedule may be adjusted accordingly.
