# UI Copy Rules for Creator Economy in Point Zero One Digital

## Overview

This document outlines the guidelines for creating user interface (UI) copy within the Creator Economy of Point Zero One Digital. The focus is on non-accusatory language, enhancing creator quality of life (QoL), and maintaining a clear, concise, and anti-bureaucratic tone.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Non-Accusatory Copy**: Always use language that guides and informs, rather than blaming or criticizing. Avoid words that may come across as harsh or confrontational.

2. **Creator QoL Language**: Prioritize language that is easy to understand, friendly, and supportive for creators. Use terminology that aligns with their expectations and needs.

3. **Strict TypeScript**: Adhere to strict TypeScript mode in all code related to UI copy. Avoid using 'any'.

4. **Deterministic Effects**: Ensure all effects of the UI copy are deterministic, meaning they produce the same results given the same inputs.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Failure Messages**: When a failure occurs, provide clear and actionable guidance on how to resolve the issue. Avoid using technical jargon that may confuse creators.

2. **Gates**: When restricting access or functionality, use language that explains why the gate is in place and how creators can meet the requirements to unlock it.

3. **Enforcement Messages**: If enforcing rules or policies, use language that is firm but fair. Explain the reasons behind the enforcement and provide options for appeal if applicable.

## Edge Cases

1. **Error Handling**: In case of unexpected errors, provide a clear error message with suggestions for troubleshooting. If the error is due to a creator's actions, offer guidance on how to correct them without blame or judgment.

2. **Gate Explanations**: When a gate is in place, provide detailed explanations about why it exists and what creators need to do to unlock it. This may include requirements such as completing certain tasks, meeting specific criteria, or upgrading their account.

3. **Enforcement Appeals**: If creators disagree with an enforcement decision, offer a clear process for appealing the decision. Explain how the appeal will be handled and what information is required to make a decision.
