# Toxicity and Moderation Evidence Chain

## Overview

This document outlines the evidence chain for toxicity and moderation within Point Zero One Digital's game ecosystem. The goal is to ensure a fair, transparent, and efficient process for handling toxic behavior, while maintaining the integrity of our creator economy.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Risk Scans**: Regular automated scanning of user interactions and content for signs of toxicity or inappropriate behavior.
2. **Outputs**: Generation of risk scan reports detailing potential violations, including timestamps, context, and severity levels.
3. **Receipts**: Creation of receipts to document the occurrence of toxic behavior, serving as evidence for further action.
4. **Quarantine/Delist/Clawback Evidence Bundles**: Collection of all relevant data and evidence when taking action against a user, such as temporary or permanent account restrictions, game asset removal, or financial penalties.
5. **Appeals Rules**: Establishment of clear rules and procedures for users to contest decisions made by the moderation system, ensuring fairness and transparency throughout the process.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Risk Scans**: Utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze user interactions and content in real-time, flagging potential violations based on predefined toxicity thresholds.
2. **Outputs**: Generate detailed reports for each instance of potential toxic behavior, including the offending content, timestamp, severity level, and any relevant context. Reports will be stored securely and made available to moderators for review.
3. **Receipts**: Create a digital receipt for each reported incident, containing all relevant data from the risk scan report and any additional evidence gathered during the investigation process. Receipts will serve as official documentation of the toxic behavior and be used in subsequent actions against the offending user.
4. **Quarantine/Delist/Clawback Evidence Bundles**: Compile all relevant data, including risk scan reports, receipts, user interactions, and any other evidence gathered during the investigation process, into a comprehensive evidence bundle. This bundle will be used to justify any actions taken against the offending user, such as account restrictions, game asset removal, or financial penalties.
5. **Appeals Rules**: Establish clear rules for users to contest decisions made by the moderation system. Users will have the opportunity to provide additional context, evidence, or explanations for their behavior, which will be reviewed by a panel of trained moderators. Decisions made during the appeals process will be final and binding.

## Edge Cases

1. **False Positives**: In cases where a user is incorrectly flagged for toxic behavior, the risk scan report and associated receipt will be reviewed by a moderator. If it is determined that no violation occurred, the user will not be penalized, and any temporary account restrictions will be lifted.
2. **Repeated Offenses**: Users who repeatedly engage in toxic behavior may face escalating penalties, up to and including permanent account bans or financial penalties. In such cases, the evidence bundle for each offense will be reviewed by a panel of moderators to determine the appropriate course of action.
3. **Contextual Complexity**: In situations where the context of a user's behavior is unclear or ambiguous, moderators will exercise discretion and consult with other team members as needed to make an informed decision. The goal is always to maintain a fair and balanced environment for all users within our game ecosystem.
