# Player-Facing Outcome: Clean Explainable Store with Provable Non-Predatory Rules

## Overview

This document outlines the rules and structure of our in-game store, ensuring a clean, explainable, and non-predatory experience for players. The store provides variety, identity, and access to additional content while maintaining fairness and transparency.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Transparency**: All pricing, offers, and content descriptions are clear and easy to understand.
2. **Fairness**: Win odds remain constant, and no in-game advantages are exclusively available through paid content.
3. **Protection**: Players' progress is protected, with no paywalls blocking access to core gameplay features or ladders.
4. **Variety**: Paid content offers a diverse range of additional items, skins, or cosmetics that do not affect gameplay.
5. **Identity**: Unique and personalized options are available for players who wish to express themselves within the game.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Pricing**: All prices will be displayed in a clear and consistent format, with no hidden fees or charges.
2. **Content Descriptions**: Each item will have a detailed description outlining its purpose and any associated benefits.
3. **In-Game Advantage**: No paid content will provide an unfair advantage over other players.
4. **Progress Protection**: Players' progress, including game data and unlocked content, will not be affected by purchasing or not purchasing in-game items.
5. **Accessibility**: The store will be designed to accommodate various platforms and devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.
6. **Updates**: Any changes to the store, pricing, or content offerings will be communicated clearly to players.

## Edge Cases

1. **Limited-Time Offers**: While these offers may have time-sensitive pricing, the core principles of transparency and fairness still apply.
2. **Seasonal Content**: Seasonal items or events may be introduced, but they will not affect gameplay balance or progress protection.
3. **Community Voting**: In some cases, players may vote on new content or features. These decisions will prioritize the non-negotiables outlined above.
