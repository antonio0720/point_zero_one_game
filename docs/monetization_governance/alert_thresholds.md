# Alert Thresholds for Point Zero One Digital Financial Roguelike Game Monetization Governance

## Overview

This document outlines the alert threshold definitions, rationales, and response actions for the monetization governance of our 12-minute financial roguelike game. The thresholds are designed to ensure a balanced and fair gaming experience while maintaining financial stability.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Revenue Threshold**: Triggers when daily revenue exceeds or falls below a predefined range. This threshold is crucial for managing the game's financial health and ensuring a sustainable economy.
2. **Player Engagement Threshold**: Triggers based on player engagement metrics such as active users, playtime, and in-game transactions. This helps us understand user behavior and adjust game mechanics accordingly.
3. **Performance Threshold**: Triggers when the game's performance metrics (e.g., server load, response time) exceed or fall below specified limits. This ensures a smooth gaming experience for all players.

## Implementation Spec

### Revenue Threshold

- **Definition**: Daily revenue that falls outside of a predefined range (e.g., $1000 - $5000).
- **Rationale**: To maintain financial stability and adjust monetization strategies as needed.
- **Response Actions**: Adjust in-game item prices, introduce new microtransactions, or modify the reward system.

### Player Engagement Threshold

- **Definition**: Metrics such as active users, playtime, and in-game transactions that exceed or fall below specified limits.
- **Rationale**: To understand user behavior and adjust game mechanics to improve player engagement.
- **Response Actions**: Modify game difficulty, introduce new content, or update the reward system.

### Performance Threshold

- **Definition**: Game performance metrics (e.g., server load, response time) that exceed or fall below specified limits.
- **Rationale**: To ensure a smooth gaming experience for all players.
- **Response Actions**: Scale up servers, optimize game code, or implement caching strategies.

## Edge Cases

1. **Sudden Spike in Revenue**: If the revenue threshold is triggered due to an unexpected event (e.g., viral popularity), we may temporarily adjust our response actions to capitalize on the opportunity while maintaining a balanced gaming experience.
2. **Long-Term Trends in Player Engagement**: If player engagement metrics show a consistent trend over time, we may adjust game mechanics accordingly to maintain long-term player engagement without compromising the game's balance.
3. **Temporary Performance Issues**: If performance issues are due to temporary factors (e.g., server maintenance), we will communicate these issues to players and implement short-term solutions until the issue is resolved.
