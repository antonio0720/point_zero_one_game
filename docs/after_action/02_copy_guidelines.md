# Point Zero One Digital Copy Guidelines for 02_copy_guidelines.md

## Overview

This document outlines the copy guidelines for Point Zero One Digital's content creation, focusing on financial roguelike game documentation and infrastructure architect design. The guidelines ensure a consistent tone, clear communication, and adherence to approved vocabulary list.

## Non-negotiables

1. **No Shame Language**: Avoid using language that may make users feel guilty or ashamed. Instead, focus on the systems and decisions under constraints.

2. **No Morality Framing**: Steer clear of moral judgments in the content. The goal is to provide information, not to impose values.

3. **No Guarantees**: Do not make promises or guarantees about the game's performance, as it may lead to user disappointment.

4. **Dignity-Preserving**: Ensure all content respects and preserves the dignity of the users and the brand.

5. **Focus on Systems + Decisions under Constraints**: Highlight the systems and decisions that players will encounter in the game, emphasizing the challenges they may face and how to navigate them.

6. **Approved Vocabulary List**: Use only the approved vocabulary list provided by Point Zero One Digital for consistent communication.

## Implementation Spec

1. Write clear, concise, and execution-grade language in all content. Avoid bureaucratic jargon or fluff.

2. When describing game mechanics, focus on how they function within the game's systems and the decisions players must make under various constraints.

3. Use the approved vocabulary list to maintain consistency across all content.

## Edge Cases

1. If a situation arises where it is unclear whether certain language or phrasing aligns with these guidelines, consult with the Point Zero One Digital team for clarification.

2. In cases where the approved vocabulary list does not cover a specific term relevant to the content, propose additions to the list for review and approval by the team.
