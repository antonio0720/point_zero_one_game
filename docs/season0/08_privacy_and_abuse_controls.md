# Privacy and Abuse Controls in Point Zero One Digital

This document outlines the privacy and abuse controls implemented in Point Zero One Digital to maintain a fair and secure gaming environment.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Bot/Scalping Countermeasures**: To prevent automated gameplay and manipulation of the market, we employ advanced algorithms that detect and prohibit bot activity.

2. **Join Rate Limits**: New players are subject to join rate limits to ensure a controlled growth rate and manage server load.

3. **Referral Throttles**: Referral systems are designed with throttles to prevent spamming and maintain a natural user growth.

4. **Transfer Friction**: Transfers between accounts are intentionally made difficult to discourage account sharing and manipulation of the in-game economy.

5. **Public/Unlisted/Private Modes**: Players have the option to choose from public, unlisted, or private modes for their games, offering varying levels of privacy and accessibility.

## Implementation Spec

### Bot/Scalping Countermeasures
Our bot detection algorithms analyze user behavior patterns, such as rapid transactions, repetitive actions, and unusual market activity. Accounts exhibiting these behaviors are temporarily or permanently banned based on the severity of the offense.

### Join Rate Limits
New players are limited to a specific number of game joins per hour or day to prevent server overload and ensure a smooth gaming experience for all users.

### Referral Throttles
Referral systems limit the number of new players that can be invited by each account within a specified timeframe to prevent spamming and maintain a natural user growth.

### Transfer Friction
Transfers between accounts require verification through email or other secure methods, making it difficult for users to share accounts or manipulate the in-game economy.

### Public/Unlisted/Private Modes
Public games are open to all players, while unlisted games can only be joined by players who have the game's unique code. Private games are completely hidden and can only be accessed by invited players.

## Edge Cases

1. **Temporary Account Bans**: In cases where a user is temporarily banned due to suspected bot activity, they will receive an email with instructions on how to appeal the ban and regain access to their account.

2. **Referral System Exceptions**: Special events or promotions may temporarily lift referral throttles or offer additional incentives for inviting new players.
