# Economy Rules: No Pay-to-Win in Point Zero One Digital's Financial Roguelike Game

Overview:
Point Zero One Digital's financial roguelike game adheres to a strict no-pay-to-win policy. This ensures fairness and equal opportunities for all players, regardless of their financial investment.

Non-negotiables:
1. No Tier Selling: Players will not be able to purchase different tiers or levels within the game. All players start on an equal footing.
2. No Stamp Selling: In-game items, stamps, or collectibles will not be sold for real-world currency.
3. No Ladder Advantage: Purchases will not provide any advantage in the game's progression or leaderboards.

Implementation Spec:
1. All in-game purchases will be cosmetic only and will not affect gameplay.
2. The game economy will be designed to allow for microtransactions, but these will be optional and will not provide any competitive advantage.
3. Achievements, progress, and rewards will be earned through skill and strategy, not through financial investment.

Edge Cases:
1. If a player purchases cosmetic items that are found to provide an unintended advantage, the item will be removed from their inventory and any associated benefits revoked.
2. Any updates or changes to the game economy will be thoroughly tested to ensure they do not inadvertently create pay-to-win scenarios.
