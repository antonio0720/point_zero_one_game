# Weekly Founder Night Event Ladder Spec (Casual Default) + Unique Cosmetic Evolution Variant Rules

## Overview

This document outlines the specifications for the Weekly Founder Night event ladder in the game Point Zero One Digital, focusing on the Casual default mode and unique cosmetic evolution variant rules.

## Non-Negotiables

1. The event ladder should be reset weekly to encourage regular participation.
2. All effects in the game must be deterministic to ensure fairness.
3. Strict TypeScript coding practices are enforced, with 'any' being avoided.
4. All code is written in strict mode for improved type checking and error handling.

## Implementation Spec

### Event Ladder

1. The event ladder consists of multiple rounds, each with increasing difficulty.
2. Players progress through the ladder by defeating opponents in matches.
3. Rewards are distributed based on the highest round reached during the event period.
4. A casual default mode is available for players who prefer less competitive gameplay.

### Unique Cosmetic Evolution Variant Rules

1. Upon reaching certain milestones within the event ladder, players receive unique cosmetic evolution variants.
2. These variants are visual changes to in-game assets and do not affect gameplay mechanics.
3. The specific cosmetic evolution variants available during each event may vary.
4. Players can only earn these unique cosmetic evolution variants during the Founder Night events.

## Edge Cases

1. If a player reaches the maximum round in the casual default mode, they will not be able to progress further during that event. However, they will still receive rewards based on their highest round reached.
2. In case of technical issues or errors during an event, the development team may need to intervene and adjust rewards or extend the event period as necessary. Any such changes will be communicated to players through in-game notifications and social media channels.
