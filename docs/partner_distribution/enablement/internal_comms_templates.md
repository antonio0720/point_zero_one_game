# Internal Communications Templates for Partner Distribution Enablement

## Overview

This document provides templates for internal communications (emails and Slack/Teams posts) to be used by employers, banks, and Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) when promoting Point Zero One Digital's game, Sovereign. These templates are designed to direct recipients to the official game website, [pointzeroonegame.com](http://pointzeroonegame.com).

## Non-Negotiables

1. All communications must include a clear call-to-action (CTA) directing the recipient to visit [pointzeroonegame.com].
2. The tone of all communications should be professional and engaging, reflecting the quality and innovation of Point Zero One Digital's work.
3. All communications must adhere to strict TypeScript coding standards, using precise, execution-grade language with zero fluff and an anti-bureaucratic approach.
4. All effects in the game are deterministic, ensuring fairness and reproducibility.
5. The game is production-grade and deployment-ready, designed for a seamless user experience.
6. No use of 'any' in TypeScript; all code is strict-mode.

## Edge Cases

2. For EAPs, ensure the communication is sensitive to the confidential nature of their interactions and emphasize the game's potential as a stress-relief tool.
