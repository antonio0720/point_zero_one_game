# Point Zero One Digital 90-Day Pilot Playbook

## Overview

This playbook outlines the design for a 90-day pilot program for Point Zero One Digital's financial roguelike game. The focus is on establishing a cadence, organizing Founder Nights, defining seasons, creating proof cards, setting success metrics, and planning for conversion to renewal.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Strict TypeScript adherence: No usage of 'any'. All code will be in strict mode.
2. Deterministic effects: All game effects must be predictable and reproducible.
3. Production-grade, deployment-ready infrastructure: Sovereign infrastructure architect design is mandatory.

## Implementation Spec

### Cadence

- Weekly meetings with the pilot team to discuss progress, challenges, and adjustments.
- Bi-weekly updates to stakeholders on the game's development status.

### Founder Night

- Organize a monthly event for founders to showcase the game's progress, gather feedback, and network.
- Ensure a structured agenda with presentations, Q&A sessions, and networking opportunities.

### Seasons

- Define four seasons (quarterly updates) with unique themes, challenges, and rewards.
- Each season should last approximately 28 days to maintain a consistent release cycle.

### Proof Cards

- Develop promotional materials showcasing the game's features, benefits, and success stories.
- Distribute these proof cards during Founder Nights, online events, and other marketing initiatives.

## Success Metrics

1. User acquisition: Track the number of new users during each season.
2. Engagement: Measure average playtime per user and daily active users (DAU).
3. Conversion rate: Calculate the percentage of users who transition from the free version to the premium version.
4. Retention rate: Monitor the percentage of users who continue playing after the initial 90-day period.
5. Feedback: Gather and analyze user feedback to inform future updates and improvements.

## Conversion-to-Renewal Plan

1. Offer a free trial period for the premium version during the first season.
2. Implement in-game incentives (e.g., exclusive content, bonuses) for users who upgrade to the premium version.
3. Send targeted email campaigns to engaged users encouraging them to upgrade.
4. Analyze user behavior and preferences to tailor conversion strategies accordingly.
5. Continuously iterate on conversion tactics based on user feedback and performance data.
