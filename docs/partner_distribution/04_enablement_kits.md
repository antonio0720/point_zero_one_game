# Channel Enablement Kits

## Overview

Channel Enablement Kits are a comprehensive set of resources designed to facilitate seamless integration and onboarding of new partners into Point Zero One Digital's ecosystem. The kits include:

1. Sales Deck: A visually engaging presentation outlining the benefits, features, and unique selling points of Point Zero One Digital's offerings.

2. ROI Framing: Templates and guidelines for demonstrating the potential return on investment (ROI) that partners can expect from collaborating with us.

3. Onboarding Scripts: Detailed scripts to guide both our team and partners through the initial stages of collaboration, ensuring a smooth transition.

4. Internal Comms Templates: Pre-written templates for internal communications between Point Zero One Digital teams and partner representatives.

5. QBR Template: A quarterly business review (QBR) template to track progress, address challenges, and plan future collaborations.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Consistency**: All resources must adhere to Point Zero One Digital's brand guidelines for visual identity, tone of voice, and messaging.

2. **Clarity**: All materials should be easy to understand, concise, and free from jargon or technical complexities that may confuse partners.

3. **Determinism**: All effects, whether in the sales process, ROI calculations, or QBRs, must be deterministic to ensure predictability and trust.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Sales Deck**: The sales deck will be created using Figma for design and Google Slides for presentation. It will include visuals, bullet points, and infographics to effectively communicate our value proposition.

2. **ROI Framing**: ROI framing templates will be provided in Microsoft Word or Google Docs format, with clear instructions on how to calculate potential returns based on partner-specific data.

3. **Onboarding Scripts**: Onboarding scripts will be written for various stages of the partnership lifecycle and delivered as PDF documents or shared via a collaboration platform like Notion or Confluence.

4. **Internal Comms Templates**: Internal communication templates will be provided in email format, ensuring consistency across all correspondence.

5. **QBR Template**: The QBR template will be created using Google Sheets for data tracking and Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides for presentation purposes.

## Edge Cases

1. **Partner-specific ROI calculations**: In cases where a partner requires custom calculations, our team will work closely with them to ensure accurate and relevant ROI projections.

2. **Language localization**: If a partner operates in a non-English speaking region, the sales deck and onboarding scripts may need to be translated. Point Zero One Digital will provide guidelines for this process.

3. **Custom QBR metrics**: While the QBR template is designed to cover common metrics, partners may require additional or custom metrics to be tracked. Our team will work with them to modify the template as needed.
