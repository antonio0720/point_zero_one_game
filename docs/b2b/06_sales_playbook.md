# Point Zero One Digital B2B Sales Playbook

## Overview

This playbook outlines our strategy for targeting and selling to ICPs (employers with 200+ employees, schools with financial literacy mandate, churches with stewardship programs). It includes discovery questions, objection handling, proof-of-concept template, and a close checklist.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Strict adherence to Point Zero One Digital's code principles: TypeScript strict mode, deterministic effects, no use of 'any'.
2. Tailoring our pitch to the specific needs and pain points of each ICP.
3. Thorough understanding of the ICP's infrastructure requirements before proposing solutions.
4. Providing a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the value and effectiveness of our digital infrastructure architecture design.
5. Handling objections with transparency, empathy, and a focus on finding mutually beneficial solutions.
6. Following the close checklist to ensure a smooth and successful closing process.

## Implementation Spec

### Discovery Questions

1. What is your current infrastructure setup?

2. Design and implement a small, targeted solution that addresses this issue using Point Zero One Digital's digital infrastructure architecture.
3. Present the proof-of-concept to the ICP, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for further improvements across their entire infrastructure.

### Close Checklist

1. Schedule a meeting with key decision-makers within the ICP.
2. Present our digital infrastructure architecture design, addressing any objections or concerns.
3. Provide a detailed proposal outlining the benefits, costs, and timeline for implementation.
4. Negotiate terms and conditions, ensuring they align with Point Zero One Digital's non-negotiables.
