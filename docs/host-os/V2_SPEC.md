# Point Zero One Digital - Host OS v2 Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the specifications for Version 2 of our Host Operating System (Host OS), designed to facilitate a seamless onboarding process, manage host streak rewards and cosmetics, organize community night matchmaking, automate clip packaging pipeline, and produce weekly highlight reels.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Onboarding Funnel**: A clear and concise sequence of steps to guide new hosts through the setup process, ensuring a consistent experience for all users.
2. **Host Streak Rewards + Cosmetics**: A system that rewards hosts based on their consecutive online hours, offering cosmetic enhancements as incentives.
3. **Community Night Matchmaking Format**: An organized format for community nights, promoting fair and engaging gameplay experiences.
4. **Automated Clip Packaging Pipeline**: An automated process to collect, package, and distribute game clips for easy sharing and promotion.
5. **Weekly Highlight Reel**: A compilation of the most exciting moments from the previous week's games, showcasing top performances and memorable events.

## Implementation Spec

### Onboarding Funnel

The onboarding funnel will consist of a series of interactive tutorials and prompts that guide new hosts through the setup process. The funnel will cover essential topics such as account creation, game installation, configuration settings, and connection to the Point Zero One Digital network.

### Host Streak Rewards + Cosmetics

The host streak rewards system will track a host's consecutive online hours and offer cosmetic enhancements as incentives for continued participation. These rewards may include unique avatars, custom game skins, or exclusive in-game items. The system will be designed to encourage long-term engagement while maintaining fairness among all hosts.

### Community Night Matchmaking Format

Community nights will follow a round-robin matchmaking format, ensuring that each host plays against a diverse set of opponents over the course of the event. Matches will be randomly assigned based on skill level and availability to promote balanced gameplay and minimize wait times.

### Automated Clip Packaging Pipeline

The automated clip packaging pipeline will collect game clips during matches, automatically package them into shareable formats (e.g., GIFs, videos), and distribute them to the relevant parties (e.g., hosts, spectators). This process will be designed to minimize manual intervention and maximize efficiency.

### Weekly Highlight Reel

The weekly highlight reel will be compiled by our team of editors, who will select the most exciting moments from the previous week's games. The reel will be distributed across various platforms (e.g., social media, YouTube) to promote the game and showcase top performances.

## Edge Cases

1. **Onboarding Funnel**: In cases where a host encounters technical difficulties during the onboarding process, they should have access to troubleshooting resources or support channels for assistance.
2. **Host Streak Rewards + Cosmetics**: If a host experiences an unexpected disconnection or system crash that prevents them from maintaining their streak, a grace period may be implemented to account for such occurrences.
3. **Community Night Matchmaking Format**: In the event of an uneven number of participants during community nights, alternative matchmaking strategies (e.g., free-for-all) may be employed to ensure all hosts have the opportunity to play.
4. **Automated Clip Packaging Pipeline**: If a clip fails to package correctly due to technical issues or errors, manual intervention may be required to resolve the issue and ensure the clip is properly distributed.
5. **Weekly Highlight Reel**: In cases where there are not enough exciting moments to compile into a weekly highlight reel, alternative content (e.g., developer insights, behind-the-scenes footage) may be included to maintain viewer engagement.
