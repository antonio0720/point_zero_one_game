# Point Zero One Digital Ops Runbook

## Overview

This runbook outlines the procedures for onboarding institutions, handling Single Sign-On (SSO) issues, managing the report pipeline, and ensuring privacy-safe incident communications within Point Zero One Digital's infrastructure.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Strict adherence to production-grade, deployment-ready Sovereign Infrastructure Architecture design principles.
2. Use of TypeScript with a strict 'no any' policy and strict mode enabled for all code.
3. All effects are deterministic to ensure consistency and predictability.
4. Zero tolerance for bureaucracy or fluff in documentation and communication.

## Implementation Spec

### Onboarding Institutions

1. Verify institution eligibility based on predefined criteria.
2. Provide a clear onboarding process with step-by-step instructions.
3. Ensure all necessary permissions and access are granted upon successful onboarding.
4. Document the onboarding process for future reference.

### Single Sign-On (SSO) Issues

1. Identify the root cause of SSO issues through thorough troubleshooting.
2. Implement temporary workarounds if necessary to maintain service availability.
3. Address the underlying issue and implement a permanent solution.
4. Document the incident, including root cause analysis and resolution steps, for future reference.

### Report Pipeline

1. Establish clear reporting channels for various types of incidents or issues.
2. Ensure reports are processed efficiently and effectively.
3. Implement automated notifications for critical incidents to relevant stakeholders.
4. Document the report pipeline for future reference and continuous improvement.

### Privacy-Safe Incident Communications

1. Adhere to strict privacy policies when communicating about incidents or issues.
2. Ensure all communications are secure, encrypted, and compliant with relevant regulations.
3. Implement a system for tracking and managing privacy-related communications.
4. Document privacy incident procedures and best practices for future reference.

## Edge Cases

1. In the event of a major incident or outage, escalate to the Incident Response Team (IRT) immediately.
2. For complex onboarding cases, consult with the Onboarding Committee before proceeding.
3. If SSO issues persist despite troubleshooting efforts, engage the Security team for further assistance.
