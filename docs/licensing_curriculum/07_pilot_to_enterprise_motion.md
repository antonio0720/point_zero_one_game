# Point Zero One Digital - GTM Motion for Sovereign Infrastructure Architect Design

## Overview

This document outlines the Go-To-Market (GTM) motion for the 12-minute financial roguelike game, Point Zero One Digital. The motion aims to transition a 30-day pilot into an annual subscription, expand cohorts, and renew via new term packs, benchmarks, and seasonal cadence.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **TypeScript**: All code adheres to strict TypeScript mode, ensuring type safety and avoiding the use of 'any'.
2. **Deterministic Effects**: All game effects are designed to be deterministic, ensuring fairness and reproducibility.
3. **Production-Grade Deployment**: The infrastructure is built for production-grade deployment, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## Implementation Spec

### 30-Day Pilot

1. Potential customers are onboarded for a 30-day trial of the game.
2. Customers receive access to the game and support during this period.
3. At the end of the pilot, feedback is collected from customers.

### Annual Subscription

1. Customers who complete the pilot and express interest are offered an annual subscription.
2. The annual subscription includes access to the game, updates, and priority support.
3. Renewal notices are sent out before the end of each subscription term.

### Expand Cohorts

1. New cohorts of customers are onboarded periodically, ensuring a steady flow of new users.
2. Existing customers can refer new users to receive benefits or incentives.
3. Marketing efforts are focused on attracting new customers and retaining existing ones.

### Renewal via New Term Packs + Benchmarks + Seasonal Cadence

1. At the end of each subscription term, a new term pack is offered, which may include additional features or content.
2. Performance benchmarks are provided to demonstrate the value of the game and encourage renewals.
3. The renewal process is timed with seasonal events or updates to create excitement and anticipation.

## Edge Cases

1. **Customer Churn**: Strategies for reducing customer churn, such as offering discounts or personalized support, are implemented.
2. **Technical Issues**: A robust incident response plan is in place to address any technical issues that may arise during the subscription period.
3. **Regional Differences**: Localization efforts are made to ensure the game is accessible and appealing to a global audience.
