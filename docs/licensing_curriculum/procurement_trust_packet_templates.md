# Procurement Trust Packet Templates

This document outlines the structure and required claims for Procurement Trust Packet templates used in Point Zero One Digital projects.

## Overview

The Procurement Trust Packet is a standardized template that outlines the non-negotiables, implementation specifications, and edge cases for our software solutions. It serves as a foundation of trust between us and our clients, ensuring transparency and adherence to our strict coding standards.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **TypeScript**: All code is written in TypeScript, adhering to strict mode.
2. **Deterministic Effects**: All effects within the game are deterministic, ensuring fairness and reproducibility.
3. **No 'Any' Type**: The use of 'any' type is strictly prohibited in TypeScript to maintain type safety and readability.
4. **Production-Grade Code**: All code is production-ready and deployment-ready, meeting the highest standards of quality.
5. **Sovereign Infrastructure Architecture**: Our infrastructure designs prioritize sovereignty, ensuring control over our digital assets and data.

## Implementation Spec

1. **Overview**: Briefly describe the game's features, mechanics, and intended audience.
2. **Code Structure**: Detail the organization of the codebase, including modules, classes, and functions.
3. **TypeScript Configuration**: Explain the TypeScript configuration, including compiler options and linting rules.
4. **Testing Strategy**: Outline the testing strategy, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
5. **Deployment Process**: Describe the deployment process, including build steps, environment variables, and deployment targets.
6. **Data Posture**: Detail how data is handled within the game, including storage, encryption, and privacy considerations.
7. **Integrity**: Explain how the integrity of the game is maintained, including version control, code signing, and checksums.

## Edge Cases

1. **Rare Game States**: Describe how rare or edge game states are handled to ensure a smooth player experience.
2. **Error Handling**: Detail the error handling strategy, including logging, reporting, and recovery mechanisms.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Explain any considerations for cross-platform compatibility, if applicable.
