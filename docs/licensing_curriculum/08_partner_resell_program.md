# Point Zero One Digital Partner Resell Program

This document outlines the rules and guidelines for our Partner Resell Program.

## Overview

The Partner Resell Program is designed to enable partners to resell Point Zero One Digital's products, sharing a portion of the revenue generated. The program includes rev-share tiers, an enablement kit, lead registration rules, and co-marketing compliance guidelines.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Rev-Share Tiers**: Partners will be placed into one of three rev-share tiers based on their sales performance: Bronze, Silver, or Gold. Each tier offers different revenue share percentages for the partner.

2. **Enablement Kit Contents**: The enablement kit provides partners with all necessary resources to effectively sell and support Point Zero One Digital's products. This includes marketing materials, technical documentation, sales training, and access to our support team.

3. **Lead Registration Rules**: Partners must register all leads generated through their own efforts using the provided lead registration form. Failure to do so may result in forfeiture of revenue share.

4. **Co-Marketing Compliance**: All co-marketing activities between Point Zero One Digital and partners must comply with our brand guidelines and be approved by our marketing team prior to execution.

## Implementation Spec

1. To join the Partner Resell Program, potential partners must complete an application form available on our website.

2. Once accepted into the program, partners will receive access to the enablement kit via a secure online portal.

3. Partners are responsible for registering leads using the provided lead registration form within 24 hours of initial contact.

4. Co-marketing activities must be approved by Point Zero One Digital's marketing team at least two weeks prior to execution.

## Edge Cases

1. In cases where a partner generates multiple leads from a single source, only the first lead should be registered for revenue share purposes.

2. If a partner fails to register leads as required, Point Zero One Digital reserves the right to adjust their rev-share tier or terminate the partnership.
