## Overview

At Point Zero One Digital, we prioritize fairness and integrity in our games. Our flagship title, a 12-minute financial roguelike game, operates on sovereign infrastructure with strict adherence to production-grade, deployment-ready standards. This document outlines our anti-cheat measures, non-negotiables, implementation specifics, and edge cases.

## Non-Negotiables

4. **Fairness**: We do not tolerate cheating, and we take appropriate action against offenders while ensuring due process is followed.

## Implementation Spec

### Cheat Detection

1. **Replay Mismatch**: Our system compares player actions with a reference model to detect any deviations that could indicate cheating.
2. **Device Anomaly**: Unusual device behavior, such as rapid input or unrealistic performance, may trigger further investigation.
3. **Implausible Outcomes**: Extremely unlikely game outcomes, especially those resulting in significant financial gains, are flagged for review.

### Cheat Response

1. **No Public Shaming**: We do not disclose the identities or actions of suspected cheaters publicly.
2. **No Accusation Without Evidence**: We only take action against players based on concrete evidence gathered by our anti-cheat system.
3. **Appeal Process**: Suspended players have the opportunity to appeal their ban, providing an explanation for any detected anomalies in their gameplay.

### Edge Cases

1. **Innocent Until Proven Guilty**: Players are considered innocent until proven guilty based on our anti-cheat system's findings and the review of any appeals.
2. **False Positives**: In rare cases, legitimate players may be flagged due to unusual gameplay or device behavior. These instances will be reviewed, and appropriate action will be taken if necessary.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Our anti-cheat system is continually updated and refined to stay ahead of evolving cheating tactics.
