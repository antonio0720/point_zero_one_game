# Mission Alignment Statement for Point Zero One Digital

## Overview

This document outlines our mission alignment strategy, focusing on measurable ways we help people and maintain a dignity-first approach. We will discuss After Action Plans (AAPs), Play-to-Prosper donations, B2B wellness outcomes, and anonymized risk literacy improvement data.

## Non-Negotiables

1. No shame framing: Our language and communication will always prioritize empathy and respect for our users and partners.
2. Dignity-first language: We will use language that acknowledges the inherent worth and autonomy of every individual we interact with.
3. Strict adherence to TypeScript strict mode and avoiding 'any' in our codebase.
4. Deterministic effects: All game mechanics and outcomes will be predictable and fair for all players.
5. Production-grade, deployment-ready infrastructure: Our solutions are designed to meet the highest standards of reliability and scalability.

## Implementation Spec

### After Action Plans (AAPs)

Upon completion of each game session, players will receive an AAP detailing areas for improvement in their financial management skills. These plans will be tailored to the player's specific performance during the game and provide actionable steps to enhance their financial literacy.

### Play-to-Prosper Donations

A portion of our revenue from in-game purchases will be donated to organizations that support financial education and empowerment for underserved communities. The recipient organizations will be selected based on their proven track record of delivering impactful programs.

### B2B Wellness Outcomes

Our business solutions will prioritize the wellbeing of employees and clients by promoting financial literacy, reducing stress related to financial management, and fostering a culture of responsible decision-making. We will measure success through metrics such as reduced employee turnover, increased productivity, and positive feedback from clients.

### Anonymized Risk Literacy Improvement Data

We will collect and analyze data on players' risk literacy levels before and after playing our game. This data will be anonymized to protect the privacy of our users and used to refine our game mechanics and educational content for maximum impact.

## Edge Cases

In cases where a player demonstrates exceptional financial acumen, we may offer additional resources or opportunities for further learning and development. Similarly, if a player consistently struggles with financial management despite our AAPs, we will explore partnerships with relevant organizations to provide additional support.

Our mission alignment strategy is designed to create a positive impact on the lives of our players and clients while maintaining the highest standards of integrity and respect for all involved.
