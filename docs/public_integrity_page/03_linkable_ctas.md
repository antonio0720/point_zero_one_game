# Linkable CTAs for Public Integrity Page

Overview:
The Public Integrity page features three linkable Calls to Action (CTAs) that allow users to verify the game's integrity and transparency. The CTAs are designed to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining strict adherence to our development principles.

Non-negotiables:
1. Strict TypeScript usage without 'any'. All code is in strict mode.
2. Deterministic game effects ensuring reproducibility and fairness.
3. Production-grade, deployment-ready infrastructure.

Implementation Spec:

### View Verified Proof Card

The "View Verified Proof Card" CTA leads users to a page displaying the game's proof of verification from trusted third parties. This page will contain a QR code for easy scanning and verification on mobile devices.

### Watch Deterministic Replay

The "Watch Deterministic Replay" CTA directs users to a video or interactive replay of the game's deterministic events, demonstrating the fairness and transparency of our financial roguelike game.

### See How Verification Works (Diagram)

The "See How Verification Works" CTA provides a diagram illustrating the process of game verification, from initial development through to third-party audits and final deployment. This visual aid helps users understand the rigorous measures we take to ensure the integrity of our games.

Edge Cases:
1. In case of network issues or temporary downtime, alternative methods for accessing proof cards and replays will be provided.
2. For visually impaired users, text-based alternatives for diagrams will be available upon request.
