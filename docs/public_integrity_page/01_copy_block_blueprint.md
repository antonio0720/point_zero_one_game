# Copy Blueprint for Public Integrity Page (Sections 1–5)

## Overview

This blueprint outlines the process to copy sections 1-5 of the Public Integrity page in Point Zero One Digital's financial roguelike game. The focus is on maintaining strict TypeScript standards, ensuring deterministic effects, and preserving privacy-safe tracking and clickable proof mechanisms.

## Non-negotiables

1. Strict TypeScript mode: All code adheres to strict type checking for improved reliability and maintainability.
2. No usage of 'any': Type annotations are used throughout the codebase to ensure type safety.
3. Deterministic effects: All game effects are designed to produce consistent results, ensuring fairness and reproducibility.
4. Privacy-safe tracking: User data is collected and processed in a manner that respects user privacy and complies with relevant regulations.
5. Clickable proof: Interactive elements on the Public Integrity page provide users with verifiable evidence of their actions within the game.

## Implementation Spec

### Section 1 - Overview

- Copy the existing text for the overview section, ensuring proper formatting and type safety.
- Include a link to the game's official website or documentation for further information.

### Section 2 - Competitive Guarantees

- List the competitive guarantees offered by Point Zero One Digital's financial roguelike game.
- Ensure that each guarantee is clearly defined and easy to understand.

### Section 3 - What Happens When Wrong

- Describe the consequences of making incorrect decisions or actions within the game.
- Emphasize the educational aspect of these consequences, helping players learn from their mistakes.

### Section 4 - Privacy-Safe Tracking

- Explain how user data is collected and processed in a manner that respects privacy.
- Highlight any measures taken to protect user data, such as anonymization or encryption.

### Section 5 - Clickable Proof

- Detail the interactive elements on the Public Integrity page that provide clickable proof of users' actions within the game.
- Explain how these elements work and what information they provide to players.

## Edge Cases

- If a user attempts to copy sections outside of the specified range (1–5), display an error message or redirect them to the correct section.
- If a user tries to manipulate the clickable proof elements, implement measures to prevent tampering and ensure the integrity of the game's data.
