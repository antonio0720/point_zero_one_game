# Retention Rationale for PZ1D Public Integrity Page (04)

## Overview

The PZ1D Public Integrity Page (04) is designed to enhance player retention across competitive, mid-tier, and new players. This page focuses on reinforcing the game's financial roguelike concept, showcasing the value of Sovereign infrastructure architect design, and emphasizing our commitment to strict TypeScript coding practices.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Deterministic Effects**: All effects in the game are deterministic, ensuring fairness and reproducibility.
2. **Strict TypeScript**: All code is written in strict mode, adhering to our production-grade, deployment-ready standards.
3. **No 'Any'**: The use of 'any' is strictly prohibited in TypeScript to maintain type safety and readability.
4. **Retention Improvement**: The page must demonstrate a measurable impact on player retention through increased conversion and return rates.

## Implementation Spec

The PZ1D Public Integrity Page (04) will:

1. Highlight the benefits of our Sovereign infrastructure architect design, emphasizing its role in delivering a seamless gaming experience.
2. Showcase examples of production-grade, deployment-ready code snippets to build trust and credibility.
3. Explain the importance of deterministic effects and how they contribute to fair gameplay.
4. Provide clear calls-to-action (CTAs) encouraging players to engage more deeply with the game.
5. Monitor and analyze player behavior pre- and post-page implementation to measure its impact on retention.

## Edge Cases

1. **New Players**: The page should be easily understandable for new players, providing a clear introduction to our unique gaming approach and technical practices.
2. **Competitive Players**: For experienced players, the page should offer insights into advanced game mechanics and development techniques.
3. **Mid-Tier Players**: The content should cater to mid-tier players by offering engaging challenges and opportunities for progression.
