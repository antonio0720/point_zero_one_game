# Public Integrity Checklist for Point Zero One Digital's 12-minute Financial Roguelike Game

## Overview

This checklist outlines the non-negotiable requirements for maintaining public integrity in the development and deployment of our 12-minute financial roguelike game. The focus is on clear, execution-grade language with an anti-bureaucratic approach.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Code Quality**: All code must be written in TypeScript using strict mode and adhering to the principle of avoiding 'any' type. This ensures a high level of type safety and readability.

2. **Deterministic Effects**: All game effects, including financial transactions, must be deterministic to ensure fairness and reproducibility.

3. **Sovereign Infrastructure Architecture**: The infrastructure design must support sovereignty, ensuring that players have control over their in-game assets and data.

4. **Production-Grade Deployment**: The game must be deployment-ready, with robust error handling, scalability, and security measures in place to ensure a smooth player experience.

## Implementation Spec

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All TypeScript files should be written in strict mode to enforce type checking and avoid the use of 'any'.

2. **Deterministic Game Effects**: Implement deterministic algorithms for all game effects, including financial transactions. This can be achieved through careful design and testing.

3. **Sovereign Infrastructure Design**: Implement a decentralized or self-sovereign infrastructure that allows players to control their in-game assets and data. This could involve blockchain technology or other decentralized solutions.

4. **Production-Grade Deployment**: Ensure the game is deployed with production-grade practices, including continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), automated testing, and monitoring.

## Edge Cases

1. **Handling Errors**: Implement robust error handling to ensure that unexpected issues do not impact the player experience. This includes logging errors for debugging purposes and providing user-friendly error messages.

2. **Scalability**: Design the game to scale as the number of players increases, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience for all users.

3. **Security Measures**: Implement security measures to protect against common threats such as data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and unauthorized access. This includes encryption, secure storage, and regular security audits.
