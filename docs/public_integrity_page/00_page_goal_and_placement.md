Title: Player-Facing Goal and Placement Documentation

Overview:
This document outlines the player-facing goal in Point Zero One Digital's 12-minute financial roguelike game, detailing its placement across leaderboards, proof, replay, and season hub.

Non-Negotiables:
1. Clarity: The goal should be easily understandable for players of all skill levels.
2. Accessibility: The goal should be readily available on the game's official website (pointzeroonegame.com) alongside other key documents such as the manifesto, rules, and press surfaces.
3. Determinism: The goal remains consistent across all platforms and versions of the game.
4. Strict TypeScript: No usage of 'any' in TypeScript code. All code is strict-mode.

Implementation Spec:
1. Leaderboards: The player-facing goal will be displayed on the leaderboard page, showcasing the highest scores and rankings.
2. Proof: A proof system will be implemented to allow players to verify their high scores or other achievements. This can be accessed from the proof section of the game's website.
3. Replay: Players will have the option to replay their games, allowing them to study their strategies and improve their performance towards achieving the goal.
4. Season Hub: The player-facing goal will also be featured on the season hub, where players can track their progress throughout different seasons of the game.

Edge Cases:
1. In case of a tie for the highest score, the player with the shorter playtime will be ranked higher. This encourages efficient and strategic gameplay.
2. If a player achieves an unbeatable score, a new goal may be introduced to maintain competition among players.
3. The player-facing goal may evolve over time based on community feedback and game balancing adjustments. However, the core concept of the goal will remain consistent.
