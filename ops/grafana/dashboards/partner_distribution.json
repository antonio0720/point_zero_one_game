This dashboard uses Prometheus as the datasource and displays various metrics related to partner onboarding, enrollments, cohort retention, reporting health, and billing counters. The dashboard is editable, refreshes every minute, and is set to UTC timezone.

The shell script for deploying this dashboard would be idempotent, have rollback notes, log to structured output, and follow best practices for deployment-ready infrastructure.
