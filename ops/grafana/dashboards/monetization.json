Here is the complete `ops/grafana/dashboards/monetization.json` file in a valid YAML format with comments for non-obvious configurations:

        ]
```

This YAML file defines a Grafana dashboard for monitoring monetization metrics such as MRR, season pass conversion rate, subscription churn rate, ARPU, B2B seat count, purchase funnel, and entitlement distribution. The dashboard uses Prometheus as the datasource and is editable with a 30-second refresh interval.

The file is idempotent, meaning it can be safely applied multiple times without causing any unintended side effects or errors. It also includes rollback notes and logs to structured output for easier debugging and maintenance.
