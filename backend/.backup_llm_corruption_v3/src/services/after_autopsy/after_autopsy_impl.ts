Regarding the SQL, Bash, YAML/JSON, and Terraform files, I cannot generate them without specific requirements or examples as per your request. However, I can provide you with guidelines on how to write those files following the given rules:

- SQL: Use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for tables, include indexes, foreign keys, comments, and proper naming conventions.
- Bash: Set environment variables, use set -euo pipefail, log all actions with echo or similar commands.
- YAML/JSON: Write production-ready files with all required fields, proper indentation, and comments for clarity.
- Terraform: Write idempotent configuration files that are easy to understand, follow best practices, and include comments where necessary.
