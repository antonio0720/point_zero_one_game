## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of key features for enhancing player retention and engagement in `pzo_verified_bragging_rights_run_explorer_v1`.

## Non-Negotiables

## Implementation Spec

### Explorer as Conversion Page and Brag-Proof Page

1. **Conversion Page**: The Explorer page will be optimized to convert visitors into players by showcasing the game's unique features, benefits, and success stories.
2. **Brag-Proof Page**: A dedicated section within the Explorer page will display verified player achievements, reinforcing the game's credibility and encouraging social proof.
3. **Anti-Cheater Firewall**: Implement a robust anti-cheat system to ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of the game.

### LiveOps - Weekly Verified Highlight Showcase and 'Proof of the Week' Editorial
