# Creator Levels and Gates

Welcome to the PZO Creator Economy Pipeline v1. This document outlines the structure of our creator levels, gates, and associated UI elements.

## Overview

Our creator tier system consists of three levels: Apprentice, Certified, and Season Partner. Each level comes with its own set of benefits, quota limits, budgets, trust scores, and next-level checklists.

### Non-negotiables

1. Strict adherence to our community guidelines and terms of service.
2. Maintaining a high level of engagement and content quality.
3. Compliance with all technical requirements for platform integration.

## Implementation Spec

### Creator Levels

#### Apprentice
- Entry-level creators who are new to the platform.
- Limited quota on earnings, content distribution, and audience size.
- Budget restrictions for promotional activities.
- Trust score starts at 0 and increases with positive user interactions.

#### Certified
- Creators who have demonstrated consistent engagement and quality content.
- Higher quota limits on earnings, content distribution, and audience size.
- Increased budget for promotional activities.
- Trust score requirements to be met for promotion from Apprentice level.

#### Season Partner
- Established creators with a proven track record of success on the platform.
- No quota limits on earnings, content distribution, and audience size.
- Unlimited budget for promotional activities.
- Trust score requirements to be met for promotion from Certified level.

### UI Elements

#### Quota Meter
Displays the current usage of various resources (earnings, content distribution, audience size) compared to the creator's quota limit.

#### Budget Meter
Shows the remaining budget available for promotional activities.

#### Trust Meter
Visual representation of the creator's trust score, indicating their standing within the community.

#### Next-Level Checklist
A list of requirements that a creator must meet to be promoted to the next level (e.g., meeting quota limits, maintaining a high trust score).

### Auto-Promote Criteria
Creators who consistently exceed their quota limits and maintain a high trust score may be automatically promoted to the next level after a specified period.

### Escalation Path for Moderation-Clean Creators
Creators who have been moderated but demonstrate continued adherence to our community guidelines and terms of service may be considered for promotion, even if they do not meet the standard auto-promote criteria.

## Edge Cases

1. Creators who consistently exceed their quota limits but fail to maintain a high trust score may face penalties or demotion.
2. Creators who are automatically promoted but quickly fall below the required standards may be demoted or subjected to increased moderation.
3. In cases where a creator's account is compromised, they will be given an opportunity to regain their trust score and maintain their level status.
